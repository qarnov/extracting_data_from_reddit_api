Most of the jobs in my country are on-site and I'm tired of traveling every day.

But I'd say build up to a portfolio, and if it's possible, try and get some sort of analytical experience through your current job. Even if it's just managing some spreadsheets. But that online course is great and would give you a solid ground for understanding the field. \n",

I’m starting from the far bottom and I understand I have a long way to go. Having acquired back problem definitely game me enough push to switch my career. I will definitely take a look at the Udemy coding course. Thanks\n",
      "Not to be rude but, is £30k a livable wage where you are? That seems abnormally low for such a job.\n",
      "can we see  also see the winning version of the resume? seems fair\n",

      "You're welcome! There's plenty of more experienced people in the sub that will be able to help you on your way. I wouldnt worry too much about the coding skills for now. Get the fundamentals of data analysis down, get silky smooth with Excel and then go from there. Good luck!\n",
      "Well, Idk where Op is from but Hungary for example has an average gross salary of around 15 k , 30k here would be considered really good\n",
