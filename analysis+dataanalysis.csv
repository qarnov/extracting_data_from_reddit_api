10onhl2,dataanalysis,1675038303.0,"Starting a career in data analytics can open up many exciting opportunities in a variety of industries. With the increasing demand for data-driven decision-making, there is a growing need for professionals who can collect, analyze, and interpret large sets of data. In this post, I will discuss the skills and experience you'll need to start a career in data analytics, as well as tips on learning, certifications, and how to stand out to potential employers.

Starting out, if you have questions beyond what you see in this post, I suggest doing a search in this sub. Questions on how to break into the industry get asked multiple times every day, and chances are the answer you seek will have already come up. Part of being an analyst is searching out the answers you or someone else is seeking.

I will update this post as time goes by and I think of more things to add, or feedback is provided to me.

**Commonly Asked Questions –**

Q) Do I need a degree?

A) Its helpful. Many job postings for DA ask for a bachelor’s degree.

&#x200B;

Q) Will the Google Data Analyst certificate from Coursera be enough to get me a DA job?

A) No. Not even close. The course teaches you some of the basic technical concepts of the industry and that’s about it. My feeling on the course is this – If you took the entire thing from start to finish and it didn’t scare you away, you may have a chance at this.

More on this certification -- It is marketed really well as being a potential game changer.  This cert gets asked about 10x more than any other.  Again, it is not a magical key to the industry.  It lets you peek in the door to see what you are getting yourself into.

&#x200B;

Q) How do I transition from X field I am in today to become a Data Analyst?

A) See the list below for the tips on how to do it.

&#x200B;

Q) I already have a degree in X, will that help me?

A) Depends on the position, the recruiter, and the company.  Most job postings show that they are looking for a degree in a related field -- Business, Statistics, etc.  The more relevant, the better your chances are that it will help.  Remember, a degree is just one part of an entire package you should have to help you transition into the field.

&#x200B;

Q) What do I need to learn?

A) Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI or Tableau is a good place to start. I would also learn them in that order. From those, you can start branching out to learn more, such as SSRS, Azure, SAS, Looker, Alteryx, etc.

&#x200B;

Q) Do certifications matter?

A) Depends on the person doing the hiring. To some recruiters, it means you have at the minimum a basic knowledge set on the topic. To others, they may see them as useless throwaways that anyone spending 30 minutes on the Internet could get.

&#x200B;

Q) Can I get a job right away?

A) Depends on your experience level.  If you are trying to break in from another career, its going to be difficult and like any job hunt, you will probably be passed up for those that are experience already.  Its going to come down to your knowledge of the field and how well you market yourself.  See #11 below.

&#x200B;

Q) Is having a degree in X enough to get me a DA role?

A) Probably not.  Again, depends on the company and the hiring manager.  You are going to improve your chances by adding a great resume and experience to your degree.

\---------------------------------------------------

**Roadmap to break in to analytics:**

1. Build a Strong Foundation in Data Analysis and Visualization: The first step in starting a career in data analytics is to familiarize yourself with the basics of data analysis and visualization. This includes learning SQL for data manipulation and retrieval, Excel for data analysis and visualization, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. There are many online resources, tutorials, and courses that can help you to learn these skills. Look at Udemy, YouTube, DataCamp to start out with.
2. Get Hands-on Experience: The best way to gain experience in data analytics is to work on data analysis projects. You can do this through internships, volunteer work, or personal projects. This will help you to build a portfolio of work that you can showcase to potential employers. If you can find out how to become more involved with this type of work in your current career, do it.
3. Network with people in the field: Attend data analytics meetups, conferences, and other events to meet people in the field and learn about the latest trends and technologies. LinkedIn and Meetup are excellent places to start. Have a strong LinkedIn page, and build a network of people.
4. Education: Consider pursuing a degree or certification in data analytics or a related field, such as statistics or computer science. This can help to give you a deeper understanding of the field and make you a more attractive candidate to potential employers. There is a debate on whether certifications make any difference. The thing to remember is that they wont negatively impact a resume by putting them on.
5. Learn Machine Learning: Machine learning is becoming an essential skill for data analysts, it helps to extract insights and make predictions from complex data sets, so consider learning the basics of machine learning. Expect to see this become a larger part of the industry over the next few years.
6. Build a Portfolio: Creating a portfolio of your work is a great way to showcase your skills and experience to potential employers. Your portfolio should include examples of data analysis projects you've worked on, as well as any relevant certifications or awards you've earned. Include projects working with SQL, Excel, Python, and a visualization tool such as Power BI or Tableau. There are many YouTube videos out there to help get you started. Hot tip – Once you have created the same projects every other aspiring DA has done, search for new data sets, create new portfolio projects, and get rid of the same COVID, AdventureWorks projects for your own.
7. Create a Resume: Tailor your resume to highlight your skills and experience that are relevant to a data analytics role. Be sure to use numbers to quantify your accomplishments, such as how much time or cost was saved or what percentage of errors were identified and corrected. Emphasize your transferable skills such as problem solving, attention to detail, and communication skills in your resume and cover letter, along with your experience with data analysis and visualization tools. If you struggle at this, hire someone to do it for you. You can find may resume writers on Upwork.
8. Practice: The more you practice, the better you will become. Try to practice as much as possible, and don't be afraid to experiment with different tools and techniques. Practice every day. Don’t forget the skills that you learn.
9. Have the right attitude: Self-doubt, questioning if you are doing the right thing, being unsure, and thinking about staying where you are at will not get you to the goal. Having a positive attitude that you WILL do this is the only way to get there.
10. Applying: LinkedIn is probably the best place to start. Indeed, Monster, and Dice are also good websites to try. Be prepared to not hear back from the majority of companies you apply at. Don’t search for “Data Analyst”. You will limit your results too much. Search for the skills that you have, “SQL Power BI” will return many more results. It just depends on what the company calls the position. Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Visualization Specialist, Business Intelligence Manager could all be the same thing.  How you sell yourself is going to make all of the difference in the world here.
11. Patience: This is not an overnight change. Its going to take weeks or months at a minimum to get into DA.

Be prepared for an application process like this

100 – Jobs applied to

65 – Ghosted

25 – Rejected

10 – Initial contact with after rejects & ghosting

6 – Ghosted after initial contact

3 – 2nd interview or technical quiz

3 – Low ball offer

1 – Maybe you found something decent after all of that

Turns out my resume was terrible. After changing my resume I applied to 40 more jobs and updated my LinkedIn. Out of those 50 total applications I put in, I got two interviews. I made it to the final interview for both jobs, but didn’t get an offer.  But since I updated my LinkedIn, a recruiter reached out to me. For context, I was an accountant and I have a degree in accounting. He was looking for someone with strong accounting knowledge and SQL/Python skills. I was the perfect fit. I nailed the interview process and signed my offer yesterday!

EDIT: Many have asked to see the resume that got me the job, so I've added it. I'm aware, it is not fancy. I've whited out all of my personal info.

I've posted this as a comment here before and it got a lot of responses, so thought I'd make a post.

**Firstly base your learning around portfolio projects BUT 3-5 Portfolio Projects is not enough!**

This may be overkill but aim for 10 projects upwards especially if you don't have much experience and you want to stick out from the crowd. These projects will serve as your ""work experience"" so the more, the better

Make sure you cover the following topics as employers tend to like this:

**Tableau**

* Sales Analytics (Analyzing sales and factors that effect sales - can create a dashboard where the user selects like a sales person, and the dashboard will give you this an overview month sales, last month sales and target). Something like this looks good [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kasia.gasiewska.holc/viz/SuperstoreSalesDashboard\_16534148636030/SuperstoreSalesDashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kasia.gasiewska.holc/viz/SuperstoreSalesDashboard_16534148636030/SuperstoreSalesDashboard)
* HR Analytics - this is always good to bring up in an interview as usually you will have someone in HR interview you, it's usually an easy dataset as well - maybe something like this dashboard ([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gandes.goldestan/viz/HRDashboard\_16284874251120/Overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gandes.goldestan/viz/HRDashboard_16284874251120/Overview))
* Marketing Analytics as well will be a good one to add to your portfolio. Really great for bigger companies who spend millions on marketing. ([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tableau.for.marketing/viz/DigitalMarketingCampaignPerformanceDashboard/DigitalMarketingCampaignPerformanceDashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tableau.for.marketing/viz/DigitalMarketingCampaignPerformanceDashboard/DigitalMarketingCampaignPerformanceDashboard))

If you're looking for ideas, go to [https://public.tableau.com/app/search/all](https://public.tableau.com/app/search/all) and type in Sales Dashboard etc. You'll get lots of ideas and you can download the tableau workbook to see how the author has created it.

But don't stop at 3. Do it for every business process - the good thing here is you can use Tableau Public which is free and publish your dashboards online, here's an example of mine that I use for the udemy courses. [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devasha5179](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devasha5179) 

**Python**

* Always nice to learn to create an interactive dashboard something like this [https://realpython.com/python-dash/](https://realpython.com/python-dash/)
* Although not strictly data analytics, learning some machine learning will do well. I like to go to [Kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com/), under competitions, filter to ""Getting Started"" competitions, and select one you find interesting. You also get to view other peoples solutions which will help you learn.
* Learn how to webscrape on Python, there's a bunch of tutorials online.
* Also nice to throw in sentiment analysis as well - maybe from social media data like reddit.

Post all the code on github, share it on your resume. 

**SQL**

And then adding some sql projects as well as that's another important language in DA, something like this: [https://medium.com/@Armonia1999/data-analysis-project-using-sql-to-clean-and-analyse-data-64a24e84b730](https://medium.com/@Armonia1999/data-analysis-project-using-sql-to-clean-and-analyse-data-64a24e84b730). I think you don't need to get too complicated with SQL as that's what we have Python and Tableau.

**Adding to your resume**

Always make sure whatever you do gets added to your resume. I generally tell my students every project you do, create a little write up an include:

* Objective
* Steps Performed
* Challenges
* Outcome
* Next steps

This is great for your resume and will help with interview prep. Having the ability to summarize your process in a way that's easy to digest is a great skill to have and will look good in an interview.

**Blog/Youtube/ Social Media**

Start a blog, post tutorials, post on LinkedIn. I find the more you network with people in the same industry, the better chance you have of some recruiter stumbling upon your posts and making contact. 

**Doing Courses**

This is a big one and I'm saying this an an instructor that teaches Data Analytics online... you don't need to do a lot of courses. 1 or 2 is enough and they don't need to costs thousands. Do one or two courses and just make sure it's something that you enjoy. Python/SQL/Tableau, whatever. I've interviewed candidates and I've spoken with many Tech Recruiters, 1 - 2 courses is more than enough for your resume

Hope this helps some of you! Also, as we know, economy is terrible at the moment and looking for a job is hard so don't give up!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/144876v/become_a_data_analyst_without_any_experience_my/,Become a Data Analyst without any Experience? My thoughts as an analyst...,366,36,0.99
q37irg,dataanalysis,1633607993.0,"Hi all,

I'm into week 4 of the 7th course, having just a little bit or R and the Capstone to go through. I also just got offered a job as a data analyst and *really* impressed my interviewers which helped with the salary negotiations. For a little bit on my background, I've a decade of experience in project management and wanted to get into data analytics because I'm feeling miserable as a PM, not able to find a job in that field, and my company has no growth opportunities (literally a staff of 10 and 1 new sale in 2 years - most our revenue is recurring so it's sustainable but definitely not getting promoted there until someone retires in 10 years).

I plan to update this review twice. Once after completing the Capstone, and 6 months into my new job. I will break it down into 3 categories, Foundations (Course 1 and 2 and a dash throughout the course), Tools covered (primarily courses 3 through 7), Soft Skills taught, and grade each aspect of the overall course in 4 ways, with minimum scores of 1 and maximums of 5. 

Qualitative review - what was good, bad, in text. Just a paragraph. Skip it if you don't like to read.

Interview prep - the tldr on how useful this type of content was in interviews. Does the knowledge spark join in your future manager.

Job prep - how useful I think this type of content will be on the job. The tldr is market relevancy.

Breadth - how much you have to play with these tools *OUTSIDE* of what the course offers to make use of them. The higher the score, the less I would worry about checking out other places to learn this stuff.

&#x200B;

**Overall comments on the interview process**

I went through a screen, and two interviews at a large institution. The first interview involved a data analyst and the hiring manager. The second interview brought those same two people back and introduced the department VP and a director of the department I am being hired into.

&#x200B;

**Foundations of data analytics**

This part of the courses was phenomenal for getting the job. Talking about the PROCESS of data analytics at a high level, how communication plays a role (this piece is really emphasized in Course 6, again foundations are sprinkled throughout the entire 7 courses), and where engaging stakeholders matters really impressed the decision-makers in my interview. I was interviewed by a VP, 2 director level people (including the hiring manager), and 1 data analyst. The analyst was less impressed, but mastering the process talk and how to engage your stakeholders really impressed the decision-makers in the room. The hiring manager smiled every time I emphasized first understanding the problem, the stakeholders, and the data - she also smiled when I emphasized data cleaning as really important.

* Interview Prep - 5/5. Definitely the most important piece for interviews, as long as you're not being asked to write code or pseudo code. Mastering the foundations impresses the decision-makers.
* Job prep - 3/5. Talking alone won't help you work with data. It's helpful to know who to talk to and how to talk, but it does not make you an analyst. Update Apr. '22 - I'd upgrade this to a 4/5. Getting acquainted with the data and systems at a new company takes time - knowing good and best practices while you do this lets you enhance your learning as you go.
* Breadth - 5/5. I do not think you *have* to go elsewhere for *an introduction* to data analytics concepts. What they cover, in the foundational sense, is *very good.*

**Tools Covered**

Spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and R are the main tools covered. Listing these on my resume was enough to get a roughly 70% call back across multiple job applications. These tools are *hot* on the market, as best I can tell. That's a much better call back rate than I got for Project Management and other jobs when I last went on the market some 4-5 years ago. The one thing many employers ask about is PowerBI instead of Tableau. I think it's important to tell them on the phone that ""I've learned the skill, it may take a little bit to get used to the tool, but PowerBI and Tableau use the same skill."" Most people seem to agree.

Please note. There are some checklists that they share through the course and these I have used in my current job as a project manager. These tools I would rate as excellent, because a checklist helps you focus your brain cells on the stuff that matters; as long as you establish and follow a good checklist you won't screw up the small stuff.

* Interview Prep - 4/5. Tools will come up during your interviews for data analysis. 100%. Depending on the employer you may or may not have to *show* what you know. Building a Portfolio is super helpful - the course suggests that and my understanding is the Capstone helps you build that (will update when I first update my review in 8 weeks or so).
* Job Prep - 3/5. This grade is **not** a reflection on the course. The market is wildly different depending on company size, and you may have to learn and pull data from a unique ecosystem of software and a unique sets of schema at varying levels of documentation depending on the company. No coursework can truly prepare you for the worst you will see out there. The real world can be very messy, and a lot of what is taught in the course is close to ideal. Update Apr. '22 - this remains spot on; I use Tableau, BIRT, and Oracle Answers as my 3 primary tools (but also Amazon Redshift, Excel, and a couple other tools) in my job. No one course can teach you all you need to be an analyst at any company.
* Breadth - 3/5. You will want to dive into Kaggle, Tableau Public, etc. to see what other people do and build your skills a little bit more than what the course offers. They show you how to build your skills and use the help documentation, which is *really important* but it does not get you to ""I am a master of"" Tableau, R, spreadsheets, or SQL by any stretch. Update Apr. '22 - See update on ""Job Prep"" above - you may end up using more or fewer tools than you'd think and it's all up to your employer.

**Soft** **Skills taught**

The soft skills really matter! Pay attention. They really seem to try to do right by the people taking the course and cover presentation skills, interview skills, strategies for dealing with some amount of ambiguity, having an ally in the room during presentations, etc. This is stuff I wish I had known early in my career, outside of data analytics. If you took this course and ended up working in something completely unrelated to data analytics, you would still take home a lot of skills that are valuable in the workplace.

* Interview Prep - 4/5. While some of the soft skills are not necessarily going to come up during a data analyst interview, a lot of soft strategies like ""repeat the question, make sure you understand and can gather your thoughts, then answer the question"" translate VERY WELL to an interview setting. As you prepare to interview, think about these nuggets of insight they sprinkle across all the courses and really record yourself practicing a presentation like the course suggests. It's super helpful to get rid of those pesky verbal crutches like ""um"" that we all use.
* Job Prep 5/5 - Some of these soft skills I have integrated into my current job as a Project Manager to great success. Some of these things I already learned from experience. I wish I had known all of it at the start of my career.
* Breadth 4/5 - I can only speak to my own experience and these soft skills help you navigate your work environment very effectively. I know there are toxic work environments out there, but luckily I have never been in one. There's unfortunately no substitute for experience here and that's where you'll get the remaining breadth in this area. The more you ask for, convey, and present information, the better you will get at doing this. Update Apr. '22 - I'd upgrade this to a 5/5. My presentation game has shot up through the roof and a part of it is doing some of the common sense suggestions from this course (practicing and validating your presentations, but more importantly ""how"" to practice and validate your presentations).

**Overall course review**

Is your goal to get a job? A+. Master the foundations and practice those soft skills. If your goal is to keep that job once you get it, make sure to dig into the specific things your company does and uses, and do some targeted self-learning. Literally, if it was a logistics company, practice with the map features in Tableau, look for those visualizations in Tableau Public, and learn to use libraries like ggmap and usmap (if in the USA) in R. 

Is your goal to become a better analyst or get a raise? B to B+. I think the comments on my ""Breadth"" score for tools cover explain why.

Update Apr. '22 - I am so happy I did A course before jumping on this career path. I am pretty sure ANY course would help get started on this career path like it helped me switch into it. Tableau is highly in demand and you don't need this course to learn it, but the course sprinkles some context as to how you get and validate that data and (for me) it helped me validate that I really do love this type of work. This is what I want to do, and I'm glad I get paid to do it.

* Interview Prep - 4/5 if you have to do a technical interview to 5/5 if you are interviewing with executives. I would say, when you are contacted to schedule an interview, it is OK to ask what type of interview it will be. HR is mostly in the loop of whether it's going to be a behavioral screen or a technical interview. If it's the hiring manager who called you, you're impressing on them how you like to be prepared - ultimately an attractive quality when you are hiring.
* Job Prep 4/5 - Expect variety from workplace to workplace. Just like you may use JIRA in one place and ZenDesk someplace else (these are both ticketing tools to log work requests), the same is true for data analytics tools. The good news is once you know R, you can learn Python. Same with Tableau and its alternatives, the variety of SQL flavors, and with spreadsheet tools. You may also encounter data in other formats like JSON, XML, and such - the good news is there are plugins and libraries to just convert this into a table, which should be familiar to you by the end of the course. The most important piece, in my opinion, is the emphasis on understanding and communicating. Understand the analysis task, talk to your stakeholders, make use of the right professional forums to get questions answered, and work with your colleagues and you should be fine (at least, I hope I will!). Wish me luck the next 6 months as I discover if I am right here.
* Breadth 4/5. I don't think it's possible to cover everything, and not necessarily useful to dive deep into something like the usmap library in R if you will not be working with map data at all (this is something I took time to dive into for my own portfolio, not covered in the course). I learned how to read the R documentation and solve the hurdles I encountered to map the rent to income ratio across the US and I definitely could not have done that 4 months ago. You're taught how to fish, but there's a lot of different kinds of fish out there.

Edit 1. Completed course now, including the capstone. No new notes other than, the less work experience you have the more you should build a portfolio as the capstone suggests. That will put you in more equal footing to a more experienced applicant without a portfolio. Next update will be several months into my new job to re-evaluate the “job prep” ratings I awarded

Edit 2, Jan 17, 2022. 3 months into my new job as a data analyst. I am loving the job and thriving. My blood pressure is way better. I’ve been a better husband at home and my wife and I are expecting. Life is looking up. HYPE.

I stand by my review, except I’d say that the job prep is EXCELLENT on the logical / intellectual side and merely good on the technical side of things. You get to talk and have kick ass whiteboard (or zoom drawing) sessions that have impressed my colleagues. My Tableau skills are still miles behind the most experienced users, but I’ve been able to quickly up my game while contributing on the thinking / prototyping end of things.

Edit 3, Apr 10, 2022. 6 months in and I have two new things to say.

1- language is the biggest skill learned in this course. Googling assistance to solve a problem you're facing is much easier because you know the language better.

2- One data visualization resource NOT covered in the course that I've found supremely helpful is Steve Wexler's blog (if it is linked in the course, sorry Google) https://www.datarevelations.com/resources/ - Wexler talks through simplifying your visualizations in a very digestible, common sense way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/q37irg/google_data_analysis_course_review/,Google Data Analysis Course review,317,101,1.0

I am still cautiously optimistic and still can’t fully believe it.  I got the formal offer and was both relieved/cried.

I’m self taught and don’t have a degree in data analysis, stats, physics or math.  I have a assoc. engineering tech degree I did years ago.  Also, have two other associates. I did it with a combo of mentorship, online courses, and other project guided videos, YouTube, to utilizing my skills to build an online portfolio.  Also, used every skill I could in my current job.  I didn’t do any certs.  Although, that was likely my next step.  I did have a background managing projects, worked closely with engineers, and did do visualization, data collection and data studies years ago.  I also have domain knowledge in the field.

This is not a brag, but I just want to tell others that it really is possible. It is doable, but the level of applications I did and applied to while maintaining my hope...was unforgiving and mentally abusive at one point.  I thought many times, and even told my wife, I wonder if Edison felt this way, like I was Edison trying to invent the light bulb or something.  I got so many rejections, so many interviews that led to only the first call only to get ghosted or rejected.  Others led to 2nd or 3rd and I did skills tests only to pass them then get told they were moving on with someone else.  Even worse was when I didn’t do well, and felt my inferiority.

I am almost embarrassed to admit how many apps I have done.  But it is well into the 400 plus range.  It is brutal and takes a tremendous effect on your psyche.

I still haven’t started the role yet.  However, I wanted to tell everyone sometimes persistence pays off.  My wife cautiously reminded me, but it “worked out” for you.  And “how many try, give up or are still trying.”  Also, the Phrase “insanity is doing something over and over again expecting a different result.”  It is sure what it felt like.

I just want to say, if you didn’t follow a traditional route....College, degree/internship...it is stupid hard.  Others may not think so.  But I rank this as one of the most stressful and challenging things I’ve ever done.  Period.

There are 8 sections but really 7 plus a capstone project (optional, I didn't do it) which includes interviewing and resume tips/suggestions. The main tools/skills covered are analytical thinking, problem-solving, Excel, SQL, Tableau, and R. The only thing new to me was R. The rest I have been using for a while now. 

This program provides an excellent foundation for starters. It teaches the basics and how to approach a project or data handling. The interviews with Google Employees provide a nice insight for individuals who are new to the field. 

The program states it takes about 6 months but it's really up to the individual's experience and knowledge. I think it took about 2 months and I was very slow about it too. I watched all the videos at 2x speed. I spent a lot of time on R which was new to me. I completed the certification for resume appeal and to see what Google is teaching. I went through my public county library which offered Coursera online for free. After this, I am planning to take another Coursera course on R and Python. 

Would the certification alone get you a job if you have 0 experience? I personally don't think so. But a nice portfolio or the capstone will definitely help. So if you don't have experience, don't skip out on the capstone.

vl4bus,dataanalysis,1656248735.0,"If you're applying for a first Data Analyst role and have no work experience at all, then it’s very likely you’ll need to create a portfolio to develop and demonstrate your analytical skills. It’s not impossible to land a job without one, but having a good one will improve your chances significantly (in my experience).

It can be tough to know where to start or what projects to develop. You don’t want to waste your time developing something that isn’t effective at landing you a job, either because the portfolio doesn’t demonstrate relevant skills or the projects are very far off base what your potential employers are looking for.

When you’re developing your portfolio, it should ideally do a few things:

* It must help you actually practise data analysis. These take time and practice to develop. The more projects you can do, the better you’ll get and if you are in the fortunate position to be able to develop lots of projects, then you can afford to start revising your early attempts and make them even better.
* It’ll help you feel more confident when you are interviewing, especially if your projects touch on aspects of the roles you’re applying for.
* You develop the skills most relevant to your future first role.

An additional benefit is that you will become more data literate as your practice, so even if you end up taking an interim role while continuing your job hunt, you might find that you can leverage that interim role to start incorporating data analysis into it - further accelerating your skill development and perhaps making it easier to switch to an above-entry level role.

With this mindset in place, how can you optimise your time spent developing these skills?

1. **Pick your target industry**

My suggestion is to first pick an industry in one of two ways:

* One where you already have an area of interest or are really passionate about. Maybe you’ve always liked Sports Analytics, Healthcare, Marketing or something else, or;
* Pick one where most of the jobs seem to be and you feel at least neutral towards it. When you are job searching, take notes of which industry keeps coming up as hiring data analysts. In the case of the Netherlands, these seem to be Banking, Utilities and Ecommerce at the moment. All of these are always hiring for all levels. I say you should at least feel neutral towards it, because I will always advise against going for jobs in industries you just don’t like. I think it could stunt your future growth if you aren’t keen on the work.

By the way, you aren't forever bound to which one you pick. You are free to choose another, but you’ll start off with the cards stacked in your favour and hopefully the first try works out.

**2. Analyse the job ads**

Now that you have a target industry in mind, continue looking at the job ads (both active and expired) and start capturing notes on them. Pen and paper is fine but a google doc that you can later refer to is probably more convenient. Make one main list for this and just keep adding to it every time you look at an ad:

* What **skills** are they looking for? Every time they mention SQL, Power BI etc add a checkmark next to it.
* What **tasks** are they describing? Pick out the key descriptions (usually listed as bullet points of activities) and start figuring out what the pattern is across them. Try group them into themes or clusters.  Even if you don’t know what these are, write them down anyway. You might later learn enough that helps you understand what these tasks are.
* How do they describe their company and the **problems** they’re trying to solve?

**3. Outline your possible projects that optimise for this industry’s profile**

With your **list of skills** in hand, you should be able to see what tools and software to steer towards. 90% of the job ads mention PowerBI and not Tableau, then it makes sense to use PowerBI instead of Tableau.

With the **tasks** grouped and counted, you can focus on projects that demonstrate those that seem to come up the most. If they mention a lot of particular analytical methods, or data cleaning, or geospatial work, or web scraping - then work those into your portfolio wherever possible.

With the **problems or goals they’ve described**, these can be great sources of what business questions to centre your analyses around. Do they talk a lot about customer acquisition? Then do some more research around the problems of customer acquisition and let that form the basis of your analyses.

**4. Search for your datasets**

Now that you’ve got a good idea of the industry and their problems, search for datasets (or create them if possible) that get you close to being able to develop projects that attempt to answer them. If you can’t find exactly what you're looking for (which is very likely), then expand the scope of datasets you can find or alter the possible questions to be able to use what you have found.

This should help you be much more motivated to build a portfolio if it feels like you’re building towards skills you’ll use on Day 1 of the job. Let me know how it goes!

xaxvwd,dataanalysis,1662838317.0,"Hello all! I'm excited to share that I've accepted an offer for my very first data analyst job! Here's how it happened...

I spent ten-plus years in the hospitality industry, mostly as a bartender, working at nearly every level from barback to beverage director in both major and smaller markets. The COVID era, along with simply getting older, brought about some serious burnout and an unhealthy lifestyle that I just couldn't maintain. I never saw my family, I was working super long hours, and not getting paid what I was worth.

Back in April I came across the Google Certificate. It immediately spoke to me. I had been working in Excel for years for inventory / costing / tracking profits and so I felt like I had a bit of a leg up. I also had a few close friends who had also transitioned out of the restaurant/bar world into tech and coding and bounced the idea with them and got a lot of encouragement. 

I picked up SQL and R pretty easily as I have an academic background and they basically feel a little like logic puzzles. I turned it into a game! Certificate coursework and query practice became a daily thing and I spent hours at local coffee shops with some lofi beats in the headphones and caffeine in the brain (Spotify has some great playlists designed for coding).

Besides the capstone project, I took a few other courses on Coursera on visualization, Python, and a more intensive SQL course, and all of that helped tremendously. I scoured through open-source dataset websites and found things that piqued my interest and created mini projects for myself.

I started applying and of course got many many many rejections but after a series of interviews with about 4 different companies I got one that seemed to be getting some traction. Although I was mostly interested in remote work, this one was on-site in my city. At first, this disinterested me, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized having a team with me would really help me nourish my newfound skills. Plus, I'm used to working on-site with people I can bounce ideas off of and be challenged by.

After 3 interviews I got an offer! It's a manufacturing company working mostly with Excel and SQL. It's $55k a year, full benefits, PTO, everything. They even have a gym in the office! I'm so excited to get started. I'm also terrified and having all the imposter syndrome feelings that many others I've seen on here deal with. I hope to update soon with some good stories!

One of the best pieces of advice I got early on was to start applying BEFORE you think you're ready. Just start getting a lot of rejections. You'll get used to them. And in the meantime, keep practicing and finding little projects to sink your teeth into. Utilize LinkedIn and the Skills Assessments they have. Put together a really solid cover letter that gives a narrative to your resume, and tweak it slightly for each company you send it to. Emphasize soft skills and do plenty of interview prep. 

Also, don't forget about Excel. It's tempting to go deep into programming languages and everything but a lot of companies still really love Excel. For good reason, too -- it's incredibly powerful and can do so much more than you may think it can. It's the foundation for data-driven business management. The Google Cert doesn't really go into Macros/VBA but take a look into that and you'll see what I mean.

Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED Talk! Wish me luck as I wish you yours!

I now make 100k in the midwest and work as a data engineer/analyst.

I am available to answer any questions.

TLDR at bottom.

&#x200B;

**My Background:**

Midwest.

Graduated in 2016 with bachelors in Sociology.

I learned absolutely no technical skills in college and had almost no idea of what data analytics was or what I wanted to do. I knew no sql, python, or even excel for the most part.

&#x200B;

# First Job

*Title = Product data specialist. $10/hour*

**How I got my first job**

(no skills test)

All I did was search ""data"" on Linked In, hit ""easy apply"" and took the first job that called me. The interview was beyond simple and I was told I was hired because the interviewer ""liked me"". The point here is, SMILE, be engaging, be human, in addition to everything else.

It was $10 an hour doing basically data entry. It didn't even require excel in my initial role. I took pdfs of product sheets and typed the information into the company backend.

**How I grew within the company**

I discovered pretty quickly that when I'm getting paid I have a strong desire to fix all the stupid things and inefficiencies and inconsistencies around me. That's mostly what I did. Without being asked, I created documentation of our processes. I created formalized excel templates. Since I'm lazy, I eventually learned a little VBA and sped up some manual copy/pasting type stuff in excel. It was a small company and they quickly had me filling in work in two other departments, one of which was completely unrelated. I was told it was because I was a ""fast learner"".

**Key Takeaways:**

Even a low paying, simple job at a small company can have incredible opportunity if you LOOK for it and just do things without being asked. Superiors notice quickly because apparently most people don't take initiative to improve things or learn without being told.

**Skills Update**

I learned excel and a little bit of VBA on the job but also spent time learning excel outside of the job - really digging into understanding formulas more.

&#x200B;

# Second Job

*Title = Reporting analyst, promoted to sr. data analyst. 42k/47k salary + 5-7k annual weekend work.*

**How I got my second job**

(no skills test)

Now I was a little smarter and expanded by search criteria to include ""analyst"". I found a company I liked and spent two hours on a very tailored cover letter. I don't know how much that improved my chances but I feel it helped. I spent probably 4 hours researching the company and preparing for the interview. I still didn't have much technical skill, but the job I was applying for only required excel and sql, I already had excel. I sold myself mostly on my ability to learn quickly and improve things quickly. I had a lot of energy and brought a friendly demeanor. These always help but I feel especially when you don't have much else to lean on.

**How I grew within the company**

At this job I discovered I have a high level of curiosity. I was given full read access to the entire companies databases (small company). I began doing my own analysis on questions I had like ""is it possible to predict which of our ads will perform better before we launch them?"" Through this, I taught myself python, r, machine learning basics and took it upon myself to give a presentation of the results. Most of this was done on my own time outside of work. But this got me immediately promoted.

Additionally, I used VBA to improve our excel work. I learned python and api usage to speed up our reporting. I took it upon myself to roll some python automation out to another team. All told, I had helped save thousands of hours of work on a yearly basis. It was a startup, no one was worried about being replaced because we were actually doing real work and there was always more work to do. I took it upon myself to teach an analysis class in R to about 15 coworkers, after having taught it to myself. I learned a bit of javascript to create google sheets automation, which we used heavily.

I took the machine learning and deep learning specializations on coursera.

And in my own time I began taking on complex python projects (extracting midi from an acoustic piano using raspberry pies, a script that would create templatized youtube videos, etc).

The bottom line is I worked my ass off and probably worked 40 hours a week at the job + 20-30 hours a week outside of work learning and teaching myself. The way I saw it, this was an investment in my future. The faster I upped my skills the faster I could make more money. And I wouldn't have to work like that forever, only until I got to where I wanted to go.

Learning coding was not easy for me, especially with no real-life teacher. I often thought I wasn't capable of it and I wasn't smart like ""those other people"". I do feel I'm slower to pick things up than other people, but I overcame this mostly because there were so many questions I wanted to answer and systems I wanted to automate that I forced myself to learn what I needed to learn to do what I wanted to do.

**Key Takeaways**

Don't be afraid to spend time learning outside of work and outside of school. You'll outpace almost everyone if you do. Take initiative within your company to improve things without being asked. Also, be friendly. And if you feel you aren't smart enough, hey, I felt like I was a dummy for a long time. I didn't do well in school. But I eventually made it. If you keep working hard (in my case, really hard) and efficiently, it's almost impossible not to improve.

**Skills Update**

Python, R, Sql, excel, vba, some javascript, good basic understanding of machine learning.

&#x200B;

# Third Job

*Title = Business Analyst. 67k*

**How I got my third job**

(no skills test)

This one was a mess. I wanted to get into data science but I found out I didn't have enough hard skills in that area. I wanted to continue growing in a more challenging role so I took an analyst role at a mega corporation, but the company I worked for had almost no work for me to do. It was horribly run and i hated every second of it. Eventually I left. I quit with absolutely no job prospects lined up and without even being actively interviewing anywhere. I had a couple months money saved up.

**Key Takeaways**

Don't stick with a job you hate.

**Skills Update**

No change.

&#x200B;

# Fourth (current) Job

*Title = Data Scientist (but do the work of an engineer/analyst) 72k as contractor, then 92k when promoted to full time with 10k annual bonus.*

**How I got my fourth job**

(skills test was writing 1 query and creating a pandas dataframe)

The biggest things that helped me here were: 1) I had done so many personal projects and taken such initiative on my own and they really liked that (some companies really don't seem to care about that though). 2) When they asked me a question I didn't fully understand, I asked for clarification before answering it. I learned later this was a huge deal in their minds and also learned a lot of people don't do this. 3) I also asked a lot of questions. That's important as well, especially in a higher level role where they need to know you're able to use your own brain and figure things out. That's very correlated to being able to ask high quality questions.

**How I grew within the company**

I have stood out in this position the same as previous positions: I improve poor quality systems where I can. Let the team know generally about design weaknesses that I see. Create documentation where the is none. Do things without being asked. Question why things are done the way they are. Put in 110% effort and make sure everything I put out is high quality. I find that even at a higher level, a lot of people still don't put in as much effort into their work as I would expect. Put in a lot of effort, continue learning and you will stand out.

&#x200B;

# TDLR

* No amount of experience is too small to get started in the field. Wherever you're at now, start learning and progressing.
* You don't HAVE to go back to school to start in the field. Start learning on your own. You don't even need to pay for classes online or do a bootcamp. I never did. But I worked hard.
* Opportunities for growth will probably not be handed to you. Find them. Create them. And implement them on your own. Don't wait for permission (if it's something simple, like a team-process enhancement)
* Do high quality work. Every time. Never be lazy in your quality of work.
* Question why things are done the way they are, particularly if you have better suggestions or see an obvious flaw. I haven't personally worked for companies that aren't receptive toward improvements.
* Work your ass off by:
   * Learning on your free time and doing things at work that further your skills and up your quality of work. This is an investment in yourself.
   * Don't kill yourself in a job that demands a lot from you but isn't improving your skillset or paying you like crazy.
* Don't waste time learning things that won't be useful to you. There are too many distractions. Stay focused. Do only what brings you the most value. I only ever focused on learning tools that would help me where I was at, not where I wanted to go in my ""next job"".
* You may increase your salary in a shorter timescale by job/company hopping than by staying in one job.
* If you feel like you're too dumb to do this work, don't worry too much. I felt incredibly dumb for a long time, but I pushed forward in spite of it.
* Technical skill doesn't make up for other deficiencies. I have seen highly technical people who lacked business sense, lacked curiosity, lacked social skills, lacked interview skills, lacked self-awareness - to their detriment. Inspect your own weaknesses and improve. Always improve.
* Excel/sql/python/pandas are definitely at the top of the list for being useful in this field. Along with tableau/powerBI. Pandas doesn't have much value in getting you a job because somehow a lot of companies aren't terribly aware of it, but has been invaluable for making my life easier within my roles.
* I feel the best trait to be a good data analyst is enjoying distilling structure from ambiguity. And you need a high level of detail orientedness. I developed this trait over time.

Maybe doing more science classes in a post-bac. Then I'd have to spend even more $$$ on med school applications.

I decided instead to still persue a career in healthcare, but not as a clinician. But I wasn't sure how.

So before I graduated from undergrad, I took a job as an Epic tutor. This wasn't a job working at Epic, I was a medical scribe at a PNW hospital, showing doctors where things lived in Epic. That was a temporary stint that lasted only 3 months. 

By the time that job was coming to an end, I applied to more jobs, and got hired as a data abstractor. Data abstractors go through medical records to pull pertinent information for quality improvement purposes. So I'd pull things out of a patient's chart like, did this patient develop Sepsis, or Surgical Site Infections after surgery? Did they get pneumonia? were they obese? history of smoking? etc. I would then enter that info into surgical data registries like NSQIP, MBSAQIP,  SCOAP, STS, NCDR, TAVR. 

This is where I started learning Excel, got exposure to medical concepts and terminologies. Learned about different surgeries. I learned about General surgery, OBGYN, Spinal Surgery, Bariatric Surgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery.

I got kind of bored of this after a year, so I applied to a masters in health administration program, and was accepted. So I did this for two years, and gained even more experience in the healthcare industry. And I started to learn how healthcare works as a business. I became known as the data guy in the program, as we had do a lot of finance and stats assignments in Excel. I also learned about Tableau while I was in the program, and so would incorporate those into my presentations and reports.

I realized from that experience though that I loved data, and not management of people, which was what the MHA program was focused on. So I did a couple of things. First, I started learning SQL, and then I also started asking my professors if they knew how I could break into data analytics. One professor directed me to one of his former students who was a director of a data analytics department at a hospital. He introduced me, and I had an informational interview with her.

She liked me, and encouraged me to apply to an open position they had for a clinical quality consultant role. Which was somewhat data oriented. I let her know that I applied, and she granted me an interview.

I prepared for one whole week for that interview, did multiple mock interviews. And as a result, knocked it out of the park. I was hired, did this for 3 months, then the data analyst in that department put in her 2 weeks notice. My boss asked me if I wanted to be the new data analyst, I said yes. Then my predcessor trained me on all the processes that she maintained.

Was a bumpy road for the first year, but I got really comfortable with the tools of the trade, have been doing this for 8 years now, and am currently a Sr. Data Analyst, moving towards Lead.

If I could go back in time, I would have probably done a dual-degree during my undergrad, learning public health and computer science. Then saved myself years of prep work by applying for a data analyst position at a hospital straight out of undergrad. But, eh, live and learn.

TLDR: 

1. Bachelor's Degree (BS in Biology, wish I did Public Health/Comp Sci dual major)
2. Epic Scribe/Tutor
3. Data Abstraction
4. Learned SQL, Tableau, Excel
5. MHA program
6. Networked
7. Got a Job as a Clinical Quality Consultant
8. Made a lateral move into Data Analytics

zauu9a,dataanalysis,1670008725.0,"So after months of searching, I've finally got my first associate Data Analyst job!

Little back story...

I recently graduated in May (Finance and Information Systems), and was working for this company in a year long graduate rotation program. Through the program I was working through different departments such as :

1. FP&A

2. Data Analysis

3. FP&A again (someone going on maternity leave)

4. Accounting.

After my first rotation with FP&A, I went to my boss and said basically that I wanted to go to another department for my 3rd rotation because I didn't think FP&A was for me. Little did I know that because of this, they said they are using my headcount to hire someone to fill that role for the person going on maternity leave. Basically it felt like they wanted to use me as a cheap option and that they were planning on me doing FP&A all along for them in the long term, when I originally did a rotation to figure out what I want to do professionally. Along with this, my experience with the rotation has been awful through 5 months... most of the time I've had nothing to do, and have been trying to teach myself Data Analyst skills while taking courses to keep myself busy.

They said I am not continuing my rotation, and that I have to find a full-time job with them immediately or leave the company. It never sat right with me that they did this, so I wanted to leave and prove them wrong. I had until they hired someone to make a decision, and I got the job before they did thank god.

Data Analysis was always something for me that sounded interesting, but I knew it was hard to get an entry level role. After a couple months of applying, practicing online, and interview prepping, I FINALLY got a role after having two online interviews, and one in-person.

I can't wait to give my former company my notice on Monday, and I couldn't be more excited to come into this field.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/zauu9a/finally_got_an_entrylevel_data_analyst_job/,Finally got an Entry-Level Data Analyst job!,139,16,0.98

Hello Data Folks! 

In order to allow this subreddit to flourish and in order to better help everyone, we are now limiting career-entry (_“How do I get into data analysis?”_), resume-feedback (_“How can I improve my resume?”_), and certification (_“What course should I take?”_) questions, where the focus is on individualized advice, to a monthly megathread. Going forward, moderators will remove posts where the focus is general career-entry and resume-feedback for individuals, redirecting those making the post to the megathread. 

## Background & Rationale

### Community Feedback

Six months ago, [we sought feedback on what to do with regard to questions focused on career entry](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/w20v9f/should_rdataanalysis_limit_how_do_i_become_a_data/) in this subreddit. The results were less clear-cut than we had hoped, with the subreddit’s participants split between continuing to allow _""How do I become a Data Analyst?""_ questions (42%) to various options for their discontinuance (58%). The top option among those favouring the discontinuance of _""How do I become a Data Analyst?""_ questions was to redirect them to a megathread.

In order **to sustain a healthy community** here, change is needed, even if some do not agree. Reflecting on that survey, in addition to many comments within as well as sent to modmail, we mods believe this is worth trying. No change is permanent, and we will re-evaluate the situation within the next 12 months. But we have reasons to believe it will help and will improve the subreddit for all participants.  

### Maintaining Balance

Many topics that are (or should be) central to r/dataanalysis are generally being drowned out by the high volume of **questions related to career-entry, training, and resumes**. The outcome is a kind of [“Eternal September”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) effect — the influx of new and inexperienced participants asking basic questions — resulting in a perpetual reduction in quality of conversations and a shift of focus away from the subject itself as other matters become drowned out and diluted.

This subreddit isn’t the data analysis equivalent of r/cscareerquestions, but rather meant to fully be r/dataanalysis. We want everyone here to be able to enjoy this subreddit as a community which is relevant to them and their interest in the core of data analysis.

### Focusing Help

**This is not to say that either these questions or new and inexperienced participants are unwelcome; far from it.** We want to _include_ you. But inclusion should not result in the exclusion of others. And past practices here are not beneficial to you, either. Rather than 100 people asking the same or similar questions in separate places we want to bring you together to maximize the benefit. Separate questions reduce the benefit to those 100 different people because it dilutes the response and exhausts those who want to help! Many have suggested, “just search previous answers”, however [Reddit’s search function is underpowered to say the least](https://i.imgur.com/Oh2YlGa.gif).

The better answer is to concentrate and concatenate those questions. Additionally, having a monthly thread means that those who ask for help might not just have their question visible for a few hours. Your question will be in a thread which is pinned for a month and linked in subsequent months. 

We would ask that those with expertise or willingness to share ideas still drop by these threads to offer feedback. Welcome newcomers and offer advice! 

## What does this cover?

If you have a **question** or are **seeking out feedback** along any of these lines:

-   _“How do I get into data analysis?”_ as a job or career.
-   _“What courses should I take?”_ 
-   _“What certification will help me get a job?”_
-   _“How can I improve my resume?”_
-   _“Can someone review my portfolio / project / GitHub?”_
-   _“Can my degree in …….. get me a job in data analysis?”_
-   _“What questions will they ask in an interview?”_
    
… take it to [the megathread!](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/10r5f3f/megathread_how_to_get_into_data_analysis/)

Especially if the question is focused on you and your career, as an individual. 

## What this doesn't cover

This doesn’t exclude you from making a detailed post about _how **you** got a job doing data analysis_. It’s great to have examples of how people have achieved success in the field. Give lots of details while maintaining your privacy.

It also does not prevent you from creating a post to _share your data & visualization projects_. Showing off a project in its final stages is permitted and encouraged.

## Future Plans

This is just a first step. There have been suggestions from community members that we should utilize Reddit’s wiki function to build a FAQ. If you are interested in helping to build that, [please reach out to us via modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/dataanalysis). And for other concerns as well, please [send comments to modmail](https://tenor.com/view/business-cat-working-cat-boss-angry-gif-13655998). We may not reply, but we will read constructive feedback and we are open to ideas.

I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

If it's not something that belong here, have absolutely no issues to take the post down and / or keep the updates to a different subreddit.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

###Stats
DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 5 months and we've brought over 1,250 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range.

There's now 1,200+ people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey. 

While in April the site grew to just over 5,000 monthly visitors across 26,000 pageviews, in May we've been able to cross the 5,000 visitors yet again, with over 28,000 pageviews - not only that, we registered approximately 4,500 data analyst applications being started from the site!

Additionally, I've also had multiple people reaching out, both in comment section of my previous updates, but also in DMs, sharing that they have found the site to be extremely useful in their job search, and that they were able to get interviews and onboard new roles through the site - I absolutely love this, and even if the venture doesn't end up being commercially successful, I'm super happy to hear that it has indeed helped people when needed. 

**Google impressions** are over 50% up, albeit the amount of people clicking through to the site remained flat. 

On the positive note - the site has finally ranking for all the major target keywords:

""data analyst jobs / data analyst job / data analyst / data analytics jobs""

Pumped about this, as having multiple channels is crucial to long term growth and protecting the site and traffic from algorithm updates.

###Things that happened
a) Expired Listings - 
There's feedback regarding some of the jobs on the site already expiring and leading to non-existing listings. I am trying to come up with a solution where visitors would be able to upvote/downvote and thus highlighting status for everyone else. For now, I went through job listings and marked those roles no longer open as ""Expired"".

b) Product Hunt launch - Early last month I decided to share DataAnalyst on Product Hunt. The idea wasn't necessarily to try and rank up to the top, but mainly get the site out there, and gain a backlink from ProduntHunt that's going to help the site's authority. Overall the voting process is extremely cumbersome, but we did end up with 36 upvotes which was more than I expected.

###Expecting a summer slump
With summer, there's typically very little hiring happening / it's extremely slow as people are taking well deserved time off. I'm expecting activity on the site to decrease, and my main goal for this period is getting together a plan of action to start reaching out to companies in Q4 and Q1, educate them about the site, the value proposition and hopefully get a few partnerships on the books. 

What that will look like, I honestly have no idea, but experiment, iterate and go again.

Some of you may have noticed that I've also recently launched [BusinessAnalyst.com](https://bussinessanalyst.com) - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 5 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck. Anyways, how this will work out is a case study for another time. 

# 2. The Salary Guide 

On a monthly basis, we've been utilising the data available to developing and sharing Market Insights - a deep dive into the data analyst job market, where we can have a look at the job openings and provide you all with insights on the latest hiring trends in the United States.

With these insights I'm trying to bring answers to questions such as: Which industries are hiring the most? Are we seeing any salary increases? And what about the remote working trend?

With that in mind, I'm excited to share that the first five months of insights were consolidated, and **[the Salary Guide](https://www.dataanalyst.com/salary-guide)** has now been published. 

The data analyst salary guide provides the overview of salaries in various industries - and now also shows a more detailed view on each industry page, with a deep dive into how much entry level, senior and lead data analysts can earn depending on their experience.

This is only based on job opportunities on the site, and no external data sources are utilised. The plan is to have it updated quarterly, with the next update in September. 

For the US, we've also released the May edition of Market Insights, you can see the full report [here.](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/may-2023-market-insights-data-analyst-jobs-in-the-united-states)

# 3. ""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice. 

The third interview from our series has been published. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

Tisha, who is a data analyst at Tesla, has shared some fantastic insights, and I'd love to highlight couple of my favourite quotes from the interview.

On what she loves about being a data analyst:

*""For me, the most exciting aspect of being a data analyst is the opportunity to unlock meaningful insights from vast amounts of data. I enjoy the challenge of uncovering patterns, identifying trends, and translating complex data into actionable recommendations. The ability to make a tangible impact on business outcomes and help organizations drive growth is incredibly rewarding.""*

On her advice for those aspiring to enter the industry, she shares 6 points that everyone should focus on:

1. Acquire a strong foundation in SQL. This is an essential tool for data analysis and manipulation.
2. Familiarize yourself with data analytics tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Alteryx. Demonstrating proficiency in these tools can enhance your employability.
3. Seek out internships, projects, or volunteer opportunities where you can gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets and analytical challenges.
4. Continuously enhance your skills by staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in the field. Online courses, webinars, and industry conferences can be valuable resources.
5. Showcase your skills and projects through a portfolio or personal website. This allows potential employers to see your capabilities and the impact you can make.
6. Network with professionals in the data industry through events, online communities, and LinkedIn. Building connections can lead to valuable opportunities and mentorship.

14419dx,dataanalysis,1686205191.0," A bit about my background. I've been working in some data related field for about a decade now. I've worked in logistics, defense and tech. I've done operations analysis, budget analysis and decision support analysis. I've also been in leadership, technical and support staff roles. I've recently helped in hiring and recruiting, but I'm not a recruiter or a hiring manager.

I provided these tips in a post a while back and I think it's worthwhile to put it into a post.  


1. Experience and domain knowledge is king. Work experience and projects are the first thing I look at, because it's usually the only thing that was really different from resume to resume. The main thing I looked for was outcome - did your analysis work/project inform important decisions? Did it provide insight into some process or measure? Did it find anomalies, discrepancies or gaps? etc. 
2. Education matters. The resumes I saw already went through a first or second cut. Every resume I saw had at least a bachelors, predominantly with STEM degrees, I'd say at least half had masters and a sprinkling had PhDs. I honestly didn't pay much attention to the education portion and it didn't have much effect on my decision to reject or pass on.
3. Most DAs are internal hires. The resumes I looked at were all external. I can't say for sure, but I believe that internal applicants went through a more streamlined process. Most of the people I work with (including myself) are internal hires/transfers. 
4. Reputation and networking is extremely important. I understand that not everyone will have a reputation or a robust network, especially those that are starting out, but if you want an advantage, you need to develop and leverage your network and build a good reputation. 
5. Certs don't mean much, if anything at all, at least not by themselves. There are some certs that are stand outs, i.e. PE, PMP, CISSP, CEH, etc. but those are very industry and job specific, and if you have one of those certs it's highly likely that you have some work experience and domain knowledge that goes with it, which will be far more interesting than simply having the cert.

If you've read this far, the final and most important tip I have is: don't get discouraged and don't give up, but set some realistic expectations. Analysts are support type jobs, we are mainly consultants and advisors, we don't make a sellable product or make decisions about an organization. We inform, illuminate and advise. Technical skills are important, but what's more important is to know your industry, sector, business and stakeholders (especially their priorities). I've seen my fair share of new hotshot analysts present beautiful and complex analyses that are irrelevant, inconsequential and sometimes even misleading. This is one of the main reasons why DA is generally not considered an entry level job. If you want the best chance of breaking into DA, figure out the industry/sector/business you want to work in and learn about it, or better yet, get a job in it. We need more analysts, there's so much demand for data driven analysis, but too few of us that know how to properly provide it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/14419dx/want_to_get_a_data_analysis_or_related_job_here/,Want to get a data analysis or related job?

Since graduating from UPenn almost 10 years ago, I’ve worked at Deloitte, Justworks, and Oscar Health as a data analyst / data scientist / data manager. I’ve also helped hire 10+ people on my current team.

**Amid the insane amount of layoffs the past two years, I’d like to help those who are 1) looking to break into the world of tech / analytics, or 2) looking to excel in their data careers.**

I see a lot of questions on this subreddit about technical skills, portfolio projects, interviews, etc - I'll be answering all of these and more through **a series of** ***free*** **online workshops** I’ll be hosting a few times a month, usually Friday EST mornings.

Samples of topics I'll cover:

\- What hiring managers are *actually* looking for

\- How are SQL, Tableau, Git, and other tools actually used on the job?

\- The top 3 skills you need to *excel* as a data analyst/scientist

\- The different ‘flavors’ of data analyst jobs and how to discern them in job postings

\- The answer key to nailing the technical interview

\- What a bootcamp *won’t* teach you (and are they worth it?)

\- Beginner to intermediate SQL and Tableau

\- The good and bad of an analytics job

\- From data analyst to data manager

\- Real projects I worked on throughout my career

\- Interview practice, resume review, and income bands

Like a lot of people on this sub, I'm pivoting into DA with a Google certificate, a portfolio of work, and a dream of gainful employment.

I landed my first interview yesterday for a junior DA role after \~2 months of regularly applying to jobs, and I just wanted to let other folks know that it can/will happen to you too if you don't go into auto-pilot mode as you apply.

For me, the breakthrough was when I finally got over myself and chopped my 2-page resume into a single, concise page. I had worked with a resume writer who insisted on a two-pager, despite my reservations. I don't think it was a coincidence that I started getting traction once I made that change.

Basically, if your current strategy and tools aren't working for you...change them. Think critically about how you're presenting yourself and to whom. Get outside opinions, and don't stop practicing your skills while you apply.

Every ""Thank you for applying to \_\_. Unfortunately..."" email is a data point that you can and should use to enhance your job hunt.

Granted, this is interview #1. There's still plenty of work to do before I achieve my professional goal, but man, it really feels good to finally make some progress.

I see a lot of posts here about which technical skills to learn, and that’s great and extremely important, but I wanted to add on something that I don’t see being discussed very often. In my opinion and experience, when getting jobs in this field, it’s really beneficial to have an understanding of business concepts as well. Employers have generally been pretty willing to overlook some technical skills I needed to gain experience in because they also value my business knowledge. 

Having an understanding of the principles of finance, accounting, marketing, etc has been so advantageous for me, and it can really set a candidate apart from other applicants when searching for a job. When I got my first job in this field, I only had a very rudimentary understanding of SQL and had never used a visualization tool, but my boss told me he was willing to take a chance on me because he valued my business understanding so much. 

Having technical skills is great! But IME, adding on these business concepts can help you convey the value your work can provide to the business, as well as give you much more context for the problems you’re trying to solve. It helps a lot to be able to talk about these things in an interview. (As an example: Even just being able to explain the differences between profit, margin, cost of goods sold, return on assets, break even points, etc has provided much benefit to me.)

12lyue5,dataanalysis,1681481995.0,"The Advanced program is great as a whole. You work on a ton of different projects throughout the course. The course is practically 100% Python. definitely more data science than data analytics focused, but they adopt the perspective of ""data professional"" which encompasses both fields. Here's the breakdown: 

Course 1 -- Learning About Data Science in general. its a good introduction to the field and pretty thorough. 

Course 2 -- Learning Python Basics. definitely take your time on this unit, especially if you are new to Python environment like I was. You really need to do the labs on your own without referencing the cheat sheet because you need to get familiar with the basics before you move onto more advanced stuff. really good stuff in this course, similar to a bootcamp/crash course style of learning. highly recommend download anaconda and python on your own, and using jupyter notebooks on your own machine rather than through the virtual labs. 

Course 3 -- this is the best course from the program in my opinion. all about exploratory data analysis, best practices procedure wise as how to do EDA, a little bit of Tableau. really great instructor. 

Course 4 -- statistics. this is the worst course from the program in my opinion because it kinda covers really basic stuff you should already know before getting into the program ie) hypothesis testings, what probability is, etc. i come from an econometrics background so i practically just did the labs from this course and skipped the videos and stuff. you do work on an A/B testing project, which is nice. but again, its basically just hypothesis testing and testing for statistical significance. really basic. 

Course 5 -- regression analysis. again, something i am deeply familiar with given my background. but really good unit. covers linear and logistic regression methods and how to interpret coefficients. covers some more advanced statistical concepts too like anova analysis, chi-square test, and other tests. if you aren't familiar with these concepts already, definitely take your time here. its a lot thrown at you at once. the most math heavy course from the program. 

Course 6 -- machine learning. personally, im completely new to this subject. it was interesting albeit not necessary ultimately. this just felt like an ancillary course added on for the heck of it. for 99% of people, machine learning isn't something you won't be doing day to day in the field. you work on some cool projects though via naive bayes methods. you do some stuff with decision trees as well. 

Course 7 -- capstone, combining all the stuff you learned throughout the program into a singular project. learning about resumes, interviewing, job prospects, etc. 

Overall Review: great program. definitely would recommend. 

who should take this program? people who completed the first program, people who already have a good foundation when it comes to statistics and data science, or people early in their career in the field. people who are already experienced probably wont get much out of this program other than something to put on a resume and some portfolio projects. 

who should not take this program? people who lack the foundation in statistics and coding in general. i knew a little bit about coding from R from the previous certificate program & personal projects. also knew a good bit of SAS and STATA from my education. its easier to learn a new language once you already have a good foundation in some others. a lot of the syntax or skills are transferrable. but ppl lacking any coding background will likely struggle. same for people who have never taken a stats course. ppl trying to skip steps going straight to the advanced cert rather than the basic one as well will struggle as well more than likely bc they will lack that foundational knowledge. 

Best part of program: frequent projects, i added a bunch of different projects to my personal portfolio of work. learning at your own pace is nice too. they provide you with example code in the labs too, so if you get stuck you can refer to the example. i wouldn't recommend just copying and pasting though from the example because you wont really learn that way. ultimately, its about learning. putting the cert on your resume is just another benefit but the real benefit is actually learning ""how to do"" data science.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/12lyue5/review_of_google_advanced_data_analysis/,Review of Google Advanced Data Analysis Certificate Program,101,30,0.99

wuzl31,dataanalysis,1661189006.0,"Hey guys, just snagged my first data analyst job out of college, and I thought I’d share my job hunt process. I’ve sent around 50-70 applications, had 5 phone interviews, 2 of those turning into in person interviews, then finally 1 offer. This will be geared towards the US, as I am in Texas. Here are the steps I took: 

1. Bachelors Degree:
Around 99.9% of all the jobs I applied for needed a degree. I have a Degree in Math, all jobs usually wanted some type of STEM related degree, however any degree could work with a good resume and portfolio. I had no internships or any job related to data in college. I have heard you can break into the field with no degree, however it would be extremely difficult to do so I think. 

2. Tailor Your Resume:
This sub helped me out a lot here. Others have posted resumes that were really good, so I just took ideas from those and made my own. YouTube also has good tips for data resumes so I’d look there as well. Put projects on your resume, with a portfolio link so employers can view it. 

3. Projects:
Common knowledge, but I can’t stress this enough. Every interview has been centered around my projects, I had to do a presentation for the data team for one of the interviews. You can message me for more details, but my project process was: Obtain an open dataset online -> clean in excel -> ask myself questions to solve about the data-> solve them in SQL-> Visualize with tableau. I had 3 projects total. 

4. Applying strategy: 
After finishing your resume, I think this is what is more important. I started out applying on indeed, handshake, and linkedin. I stopped using Indeed half way into my process, because there is way too much competition there. So I focused on linkedin and handshake. I always filtered with jobs posted within the last 3 days to a week,  nothing ever after that. Any “promoted” job listing is something to ignore, too much competition. The big thing I’d emphasize is as much as I’d want an at home job, snagging an entry level remote position without any experience is slim. I’d see a remote position have around 300-800 applications sent in. Again, too much competition. Look for On Site positions. It cuts the competition way down, to maybe 40-70 for smaller companies. All you need is that first data analyst title. So I even though I want a remote position, the title means more than anything, so on site it is. Also apply for anything that wants 1-3 years of experience. You never know what job make take a chance on you, as that was the case for my job. Be careful applying to any of the WITCH companies, you can google to see why those are not recommended. (Although I have heard some good stories working for those companies, as it gets your foot in the door.)

5. Interviews: 
Here thankfully I haven’t had a technical interview, since they were more interested in my projects. I’d struggle in a technical interview for sure, so again, projects are good. I was definitely under the gun for both interviews, but confidence is key. 

So yeah, Just thought I share that. I was definitely nervous about how much of a struggle entry level jobs are to get, but I just kept my head down and just kept applying. I also learned lots of stuff from this sub, so thank y’all as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/wuzl31/snagged_my_first_job/,Snagged My First Job.,103,42,0.96

Background: I have a degree in biology, and during peak pandemic I decided I didn’t want to go to med school.

12hql2k,dataanalysis,1681149589.0,"TLDR: it’s a rant/suggestion post about people not  understanding the analysis part in DA. Folks focus more on coding/software and not on building impactful insights. 

People trying to “learn” DA miss out such a key factor, which is unfortunately not taught in these online courses too. It is about learning WHAT TO ANALYZE. 

This frustration filled rant comes from taking a series of interviews and working with junior analysts daily (I work as a SDA for a retail company). Most of the above mentioned people I come across are great when it comes to being SQL monkeys; and trust me I know that organizations need them and you always start out in this field as one. But you are hired to find insights, not just write code!! 

Basically, people are technically sound, but they have no intuition or process to find issues and build solutions. People focus on what new visualization software is out there, not know how to properly VISUALIZE DATA. They can write code for complex KPIs, but don’t have any intuition to find or build any, ML projects are the same. 

I hope you get where I am going with this. If you are in any phase of learning or working, PLEASE emphasize on what to analyze and the different ways to treat, predict and visualize it to solve a problem or find an insight.

I noticed so many job descriptions from big tech companies that wanted analysts who could code and automate things. I started to run through Python courses, SQL tutorials, and analysis projects. I ended up landing a data analyst role at a record label and fell even more in love with data analysis.

When I got to the record label I started building data (ETL) pipelines, creating visualizations in Tableau, and conducting in-depth analysis using the pandas library in Python. 

The jump to Python, SQL, and Tableau truly was worth it, but I also don't want to throw any shade at Excel. I used to want to move away from Excel as quickly as possible, but I realized it provided such a solid foundation for what I'm doing now. 

Kind of similar to the manual and automation dynamic. You have to understand the manual process before you can automate. I feel that you have to understand what Excel does before you can understand using Python, SQL, and Tableau together. 

I want to encourage anyone who's currently using Excel and wanting to make the jump into Python, SQL, and Tableau.

It's worth it.

Keep going, keep studying, and you'll move to a point where you're comfortable using Python, SQL, and Tableau over Excel.

Get as much use out of Excel as possible. Maximize your time with it because it will only help your understanding of other technical tools and software later on.

Hi! I am ar\_t\_e\_m\_is, a senior data scientist and member of this sub :) I did create a new profile for this, but I do have a main I'd be willing to share if someone would like to DM.

I am hoping to offer an opportunity for aspiring and junior data scientists or analytics professionals to see what data science and data analytics is all about, by doing a live-stream of a data science project :). It is very common in industry, especially non-tech, for stakeholders to ask for a ""proof of concept"" quickly. I'm going to build one live :)

On **Thursday July 21** around **830pm EST**, I will be doing a livestream on Twitch with a dataset I have never analyzed, and working on a machine learning solution while live streaming :) I will analyze the dataset, prep it for a modeling problem, and try to build and optimize a model while also unlocking business-driven insights :) And, yes, this does include searching Stack Overflow and debugging along the way! During the stream, I will be talking about my career path, how I got to where I am at, and offering insight into the successes and failures of my career.

If you'd like to learn more about my background, I've included a redacted version of my resume.

1. ROI - If you can demonstrate how you increased cost savings, saved time, or increased X, it catching HR and reviewers eye. This is due to the eye scanning for $ and % signs.
2. Bullet Points. I know this is basic but if you are in data, you need to be exact and making the complex simple is a great skill. Having a novel like resume is a great way to make someone miss out on your skills.
3. Listing the Software and skills in a separate section. Often times, an organization can't hire a candidate if they are not familiar with a specific tech stack of software. This is due to the time and cost for training is factored in to the decision making.
4. Projects--List the projects that or assignments that you received list this out with how and ROI associated with these. It helps show you know how to use data solve problem.

I’m a 29 F never had any full time job before. With a all-star career coach’s help (he is my partner), I landed an analyst role in a tech company. My teammates are awesome, they are convinced that I’m a multi-functional talent with strong personality and placed me in a project facing role to deal with complex situations.

The reality is I’m beyond incompetent, suck at writing, communication and analysis. This is my first proper job, I even struggled using Excel. My major in college is landscape design and I’m a half decent drawer and painter.

Over the past year, my partner shadowed me for dealing with all the difficult situations, helped me prepare for each presentation and rewrote most of the important emails. I’ve learned a lot but obviously not enough. Something like financial/ analytical mindset is so hard to train. 

Family wise, I have 3 young kids. Meal prep, housework, taking care of kids while doing my current job just seems impossible.

After landing the job, I got vertigo several times, at least once a week I need Tylenol for headache, had one blackout and gained 15 lbs. I had many panic attacks and constantly wake up around 3 am sweating about next day’s work.
I feel ashamed and completely useless, having trouble looking in the mirror.

I see 3 options:

1-Quit my current job and find another analyst job on my own
2-suck it up and learn
3-switch career to art/ design field

Please share your thoughts.

Edit:
Thank you everyone! I didn’t expect this many responses. Apart from sharing my art work, I’ve never posted anything on any social media before. You guys truly helped me organize my thoughts and see possibilities.

I think what stressed me the most is presenting and meetings. My current role only requires SQL, Excel and a little bit of Tableau. I’ve improved quite a bit using tools and will continue to learn, but still very uncomfortable presenting. 
I gave the wrong signal during interviews, mislead them to think I’m the presenter type. Our team has 9 analysts and I’m the one with most exposure to the rest departments in the company. My manager is very supportive, whenever I need to present, she’ll always try to be there in case I can’t handle some questions. I stuttered and felt nauseated many times.

Here’s what I’m going to do:
1- hire help for housework 
2- my year end review conversation is coming next week. I’m going to ask to switch for a role with less exposure, that’ll reduce pressure on me
3- go to the office more often, so my help is out of reach. When WFH, we set a new rule where he will not touch my keyboard 
4- exercise regularly

Hi all, I've recently started my first Data Analyst Job back in the beginning of Spring and I can use a large deal of improvement in the Analytical thinking department. I do very well in creating reports and complex problem solving on the technical end but I seem to fall short when it comes to presenting the reports as I feel I do not have a grasp of the thinking side of an analyst. I then get anxious and flustered and it all falls down hill.

I ask questions, but I always seem to be wrong in my approach. Overall, I get generalized tips from peers, but at this point I'm looking for a possible solution in regards to maybe a Course or 2 that can rework my thinking (if that's possible).

13l44m0,dataanalysis,1684428424.0,"Hey guys,

I wanted to share my story on how I became a data analyst. I did not go to school for this. I started from scratch about two years ago and trained myself completely online.

Between 2014 and 2019 I was working in sales for a small business that sold industrial equipment. The pay was not great (around 35k a year) and there was no opportunity to grow. Basically, I felt stuck. I was a college drop out, I had no prospects or marketable skills. However, I was very determined to improve my situation. I found that I really enjoyed excel and writing formulas to work with and keep track of my numbers. Eventually I became obsessed. I began building complexed calculators that became really useful tools in my role. This is when I began to see that I had potential in the field of data analytics. 

Fast forward to 2018. A close friend of mine and I were talking about some of my work and he offered to pass my resume along to his company. This was a huge corporate company dealing with pharmaceuticals. Looking at some of the positions I felt that they were way out of my league. For every requirement on the job postings, I probably met maybe two of them. However, he assured me that I should apply anyway, so I did. I sent application after application and eventually, after about 3 months I got an interview for a low level position in master data governance. Unfortunately, I totally bombed the interview. But still, I keep trying and applying. Finally, after 8-9 months of applications, interviews and rejections I secured a role as a junior business analyst. 

Now, in 2019, in my new role as a BA I was basically doing general office work. Managing customer accounts, creating reports, and data entry.  I knew I wanted to be a full fledged data analyst, but this role was far from where I wanted to be. I wanted to move up, so I tried what always worked for me; persistence. However, I ran into a wall. For another year I went through the same process of interviewing, and getting rejected. I decided to step back and focus on training in my free time.

Looking at the plethora of bootcamps, training courses, and tutorials, data analytics is one of the most widely covered topics on the internet. It was very easy to find material for study, but the problem was how to find the best path forward. I eventually landed on codecademy.com as they offered a full data science course for only $40 /month. I was able to get through this in about 6 months. Along with learning the basic skills like python, SQL, and data concepts, I also started learning VBA for excel. VBA was my favorite tool by far as I was able to automate a lot of my job with it. 

Moving on, I continued to apply for new roles, but even after I went through the training, I still was not having any success breaking into a data role. I had to try something different. Think outside of the box. I realized that not having a degree was setting me back in the eye's of potential new teams, but I really didn't have the time or money to go back to school. However, the automation I had set up for my day to day was getting noticed by my boss and other teammates. They where awestruck at the potential. I figured this might be the best way forward.

I decided to put all my energy into networking. I'm usually pretty introverted, but I put a lot of effort into showcasing my skills to other teams. I created a VBA class that I shared with all other teams and many people had joined up. Through this I was able to meet new managers and could show them my aptitude, eventually someone from the data analytics team took notice and tapped me on the shoulder. They finally offered me a position as a full fledge data analyst. 

To summarize, in order for someone to break into this role like I did, you need to be obsessed with DA, persistent, and lean heavily on networking.  It's hard work, but fun and rewarding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/13l44m0/creating_a_post_with_my_experience_breaking_into/,Creating a post with my experience breaking into DA without a degree.,66,21,0.98

Questions like “tell me about a data project where you had to work through ambiguity” or “when did you use data to come up with a recommendation” type of questions. On paper I think I have the requisite requirements (MS degree, 3 YOE as a data analyst) but it seems like the projects I’ve done are not impressive enough to get me through the screening rounds. My Python and SQL skills are fine but my actual project experience lacks depth and don’t know how to improve this to get past interviews. 

I think I’m at a disadvantage because my projects were for external clients and many of them were short < 1 week projects that were existing analyses reproduced for different clients so there wasn’t too much complexity or ambiguity. I was also not communicating with these clients directly but through another client facing team. Many of these projects were on the ETL side of automating data reports with python and sql and I’ve found them hard to make interesting. I’ve done a bit of text mining too to mine insights but these were just using NLP models out of the box and interviewers don’t seem to be that interested when I talked about those projects.

Rather than have 100s of separate posts, each asking for individual help and advice, please post your questions. This thread is for questions asking for individualized career advice:

-   _“How do I get into data analysis?”_ as a job or career.
-   _“What courses should I take?”_ 
-   _“What certification, course, or training program will help me get a job?”_
-   _“How can I improve my resume?”_
-   _“Can someone review my portfolio / project / GitHub?”_
-   _“Can my degree in …….. get me a job in data analysis?”_
-   _“What questions will they ask in an interview?”_

Even if you are new here, you too can offer suggestions. So if you are posting for the first time, look at other participants’ questions and try to answer them. It often helps re-frame your own situation by thinking about problems where you are not a central figure in the situation.

Edit: Interview is in a couple hours and I'll be posting my experience later, just wanted to say thank you all so much for the well wishes. You all are the best!

Edit 2: I got the job!!

 while I feel like I over prepared for the interview, I'm glad I did because it made me feel comfortable going in. However, it seems like they really just wanted someone ambitious and fun/good to work with. They will be training people anyway and don't expect any tax experience. Turns out that the interviewers also had unrelated degrees in art and film so I felt comfortable with my sustainability degree.

They seemed like cool people and the company sounds like they're really growing and up to some cool projects with automation and AI that I'll be able to get into one day when I have a better understanding. So, lots of room for growth which is what I want. Then, ten or so minutes after the interview, the recruiter for the position called me and told me I got an offer!

Considering I started this journey only a month ago, I feel super lucky. I realize I'll be starting at the bottom but idc, I have room to grow and a starting salary that is better than my current salary in a job I've been in for years, and its remote! I feel like I hit the jackpot!

For anyone also starting a career transition, working with the recruiter was absolutely key for me in finding a job. Reach out to them and let them know what you want. Don't be afraid to ask for what you really want, because in the end they'll just find you a job you didn't actually want if you don't make it clear to them.

So I wanted to give my two cents, since I did finish it but have the advantage of hindsight. 

The google cert would be a great place to start if you’ve never touched an analyst tool, or heard of any analysis concepts. 

Since most people pursuing a data career have heard of the concepts and at least touched excel, use Maven Analytics! I’ve commented this on so many posts. I thought I needed to just post it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/13rukea/thanks_to_the_sub/,Thanks to the sub,65,13,0.99
127tqf7,dataanalysis,1680285814.0,"This sounds silly or borderline stupid, even, but I really want to know how do Data Analysts actually use the tools on a daily basis?

I know that Excel, SQL, Python, and R are some of the most common tools data analysts use, but how do you actually use it at work?

Do you use them all together connectively? For example, you use Excel to create a database then you transfer it to MySQL. Then you analyze using Python.


Or do you use either one of them depending on what you are working on? For example:
-You either use Excel or SQL to create databases.
-You use either Excel, SQL, Python or R to analyze data.

I'm trying to find videos on YouTube that explains this but can't seem to find one. All of the ones I could find just explains how they work and how to use them.

sp9wvm,dataanalysis,1644508859.0,"Hi every one, fist time posting on Reddit.

Some background and context, I am (35M) currently working a full time job as a basic office admin (mostly data entry using SAP and EXCEL) in a large scale company (over 40000 employees) in Dubai, UAE. I plan to apply for a data analyst position in my company by the end of the year, that department uses SQL, PYTHON and TABLEU/POWERBI. I am married and have a 2 year old kid, so I don't get much free time apart from the very late hour or two in the night when all the day's activities and responsibilities are over.

This is when I do my self learning. Currently focusing on SQL as i am fairly decent in Excel since I use it daily at work and will pickup whatever extra is needed as I go along.

I just picked up two books, SQL FOR DUMMIES and after I finish that I will start the SQL COOK BOOK by ANTHONY MOLINARO.


My plan is to go through these books while practicing on Kaggle.com so I learn and use/practice at the same time since in my current role we don't use any thing apart from Excel for the run of the mill trackers and reports, while entering data in SAP.

I have watched and gone through some videos on YouTube and LinkedIn, just the basics in SQL and I intend to stay away from YouTube as it is very easy to get distracted.

Will this be a good plan to start my learning journey? I am in no hurry and want to take my time so I can get my understadings of the foundations right and build up the knowledge gradually.

If there is anything else I should be doing or if I am missing anything considering my position now, please please please advice.

Fast forward to around 2018 where some life changes gave me the opportunity to go back to school. I knew I wanted to do something with problem solving but still wasn't sure what field.

13i98gv,dataanalysis,1684159293.0,"Last week, I did a post about how I became a data analyst in healthcare.

How I became a data analyst in healthcare: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/13bur30/how_i_became_a_healthcare_data_analyst/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

In this post, I'll try to create a roadmap for those that want to do the same. Keep in mind that I work in patient safety and quality at a hospital, so that's what I'll focus on here. But there's tons of places in healthcare you can work. Insurance, Biopharma, Research, Genomics, etc.

I invite my fellow redditors who are also healthcare data analysts to contribute to this guide.

1. First, it's going to be very tough to get into this field without a college degree of some sort. The degree doesn’t necessarily have to be clinical or healthcare-oriented. In fact, most of my co-workers have only a 4 year degree, and their majors are widely varied: physics, English, biology, psychology, etc. 

Personally, I majored in Biology, I eventually also got a Masters in Health Admin, but I don’t think I needed this, and it was verrrry expensive.. If I were to go back in time and do it over again, I would have just done a dual-major in Public Health and Comp Sci.

2. Work experience: most of my coworkers, myself included, started in an entry-level role in healthcare that involved working with data to some extent. Project Assistant, Program Coordinator, Research Coordinator, Data Entry/Data Abstractor (the latter is what I did before becoming a data analyst).

One tactic to work your way into data analytics at this stage is try getting a mentorship with a data analyst, and work in some projects involving SQL, and Data viz like Tableau/PowerBI. I’ve seen people at my hospital make their way into analytics after completing a mentorship program, and then applying internally to entry or junior roles when there is an opening.

3. Hard Skills: Learn SQL, Excel, Tableau/PowerBi. Tons of free resources online. When I learned SQL, I started off on SQLzoo.net, and once I got the hang of the fundamentals, I did SQL challenges on codewars.com. If I were to go back in time, I would have also tried personal projects with a free SQL resource like Postgres or MySQL.

With Data Viz, I like Tableau Public. It’s free, and it is quick to learn the basics, but can take years to get so good that you can make your work not only look stylish, but practical at the same time. So don’t be discouraged if your stuff looks like garbage at first. My certainly did, and my crappy portfolio still landed me a job back in 2016. 

One way you can learn the fundamentals is by just following several tutorials on Youtube. Almost like understanding how a board game works by learning the rules as you play.

4. Portfolio Development: Once you’ve gotten the hang of things, check out Vizzendata.com. The author, Lindsay Betzendahl, is a Tableau Ambassador and Zen Master in the Public Health space, and has curated a wide collection of Healthcare and Public Health data over the past couple of years. And this has resulted in a very impressive suite of dashboards on Tableau Public published under the hashtag #ProjectHealthViz. See if you can make some on your own, without following a tutorial. Then compare your work to what others have done to see if you thought similarly to your peers, and if your line of thinking is on the right track.

Develop at least 3 entries in your portfolio so that you can display them during an interview. 

It would be awesome if you could incorporate something about Health Equity, and social disparities in the portfolio, because this is a very important subject that hospitals are starting to embrace.

5. Building Domain Knowledge in Healthcare: the buzzwords I often see for data analyst positions in healthcare are “Quality”, “Process Improvement” and “Metrics”. Besides working in the healthcare space (See step #2), some other ways you can get knowledgeable about patient quality and process improvement in healthcare is to do these things:

• Visit the IHI Open School and complete their 20 hour online training (Free if you have a .edu email account, or if you live in a WHO-designated least developed country). This teaches you the basics of quality, patient safety, and process improvement

• Can’t get the free version? They also have some free online videos on their website. But if you want more, and can’t afford their pricetag for the complete series, there are cheaper courses that are also good on udemy/coursera.

• Understand what ICD-10-CM codes, CPT codes (I think these are confusingly also HCPCS Level I, but don’t quote me on that!), and ICD-10-PCS codes are. I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to learn what HCPCS Level II, LOINC, and SNOMED are as well. But I barely know them myself, and haven’t yet needed to know what they do.

• Understand what Donabedian’s Model is, as well as the 6 domains of care (AKA the SEPTEE model)

• Read anything by Atul Gawande (I like his books the Checklist Manifesto, and Complications)

• Read the executive summaries of “To Err is Human” and “Crossing the Quality Chasm”. These articles are eye-opening. Somewhere between 100k to 400k people die every year due to avoidable medical errors. It’s more dangerous being a patient in a hospital than a passenger or driver of a car.

• Metrics: Figure out what ALOS, HAIs, Readmissions, Patient Census and ADEs are. This is just a short list of well-known metrics that are nice to know. There’s plenty of others, but there are so many that it will be impossible to memorize them all. If you are curious about the many types that exist, check out the national quality forum (NQF). They endorse tons of metrics. 

6. Network Network Network. I didn’t get my first job by mass applying to positions. Nowadays, it’s easier for me to get noticed via applications because I have built up a good resume. But when I first started out, I had to do informational interviews. And this is still my most effective strategy to landing an interview.

Here’s the idea. Connect with as many people as you know personally on LinkedIn. The more people you know/get to know and later connect with on Linkedin, the greater the probability that one of those connections works with healthcare data (your 1st contacts), or knows someone that works with healthcare data (your 2nd contacts).

Go to linkedin.com, search for the hospital system you want to work for, see the people that work there, and look for the 1st contacts and 2nd contacts in that order. Reach out directly to your 1st contacts, or if you only see 2nd contacts, ask the 1st contact to introduce you to the 2nd contact. Either way, ask the person working there if you can get an informational interview to learn more about the work they do.

When this informational interview happens, this is your opportunity to learn more about the work that they do, what they like about the company and their job, etc.

The informational interview is also helping you make a good first impression on someone who may influence the hiring process, and you are gently hinting to that person that you want a job where they work as a data analyst. It sounds flimsy, but I firmly believe that this will get you much further than mass applying to jobs. This process got me my first interview (and subsequently, my first job). I still continue to do this, and not too long ago, it got me an interview at a very prestigious hospital (though I didn’t get the job, ugh!).

So I’d recommend trying out both of these strategies to cast as wide of a net as possible.

The job market is tough out there, so I hope this is helpful in some way. 

TLDR:

•	Step 1: Four year degree
•	Step 2: Work Experience in Healthcare (Program Coordinator, Project Assistant, Research assistant, data entry, etc.)
•	Step 3: SQL, Excel, Tableau
•	Step 4: Portfolio of 3 items. Try to make them healthcare-themed. Try to incorporate health equity in one of them.
•	Step 5: Build knowledge of basic coding concepts, patient safety and quality concepts, and metrics
•	Step 6: Network, a lot.

zkpf2b,dataanalysis,1670915454.0,"**TLDR**: Did my BS in Biology, Withdraw from Optometry School, Enroll back to my college's Master in DA, Apply to Summer Internship very early, Apply to Full time Job early on, 7 Interview Invites, 1 Job Offer. Copy  of my resume at the bottom.

# Intro

This is not a brag post and I hope my experience helped someone deciding to transition into a new field and on the fence on doing a Masters or not.

I graduated with my BS in Biology a couple of years ago when the pandemic was in a full swing. I was accepted to an Optometry School and was planning to attend after graduation. Unfortunately, they announced that they were changing the modality to Online and I didn't think it was worth paying $65K a year, for 4 years, just to be saturated with debt to be an Optometrist. After some research, I did decided to enroll back into my Alma Mater in their Masters Program in Data Analytics.

&#x200B;

# Master Program

I am no way a scholar student. I had a 3.2 GPA in Biology and withdrew from Chemistry and Organic Chemistry classes before passing with a B-. I noticed my college had a evening Masters program in DA. Strangely, it stated that you could complete the Pre-Reqs the same time as you complete the Core Master Courses. I had almost no experience in Excel, or any programming at all so I was hesitant to enroll. After talking to the graduate counselor, I decided to enroll into the program which took me 3 semesters to finish.

The program was a little bit weird. It was set up for people who have absolute no experience to people that have experience in the field. Languages use were SQL, R, and Python. You could even take electives and learn to use SAS. There was some classes I took that taught advanced Data Mining methods (Neural Network, Association Rule, Clustering etc.). I was expose to using STATA and some Tableau for at least one of my courses. Honestly, it felt more like a Data Science program versus an Data Analytics program. While I took a Pre-Req and an Advanced course in SQL which I had a solid understanding in, but the Python and R Course was pretty lacking. They taught the course with the understanding that the class was a mixture of language proficiency. They didn't teach the very basics and the homework + exams were just changing variables and numbers around. I could look at the code and explain what the code was doing but if you ask me to write it from scratch, I could not do it.

Overall it was an okay Program. They started the program about 4 years ago and definitely were trying to fix the curriculum around to see what worked and not. 50% of the professors that taught this course had full time jobs on the side. It was nice hearing how the stuff we learned in class and which how they apply it to their day job.

&#x200B;

# Internship

I knew from the very start, if I want to find a full time job, I needed some experience. The most impactful way to get one is getting a Summer Internship. If I learn anything about grad school's rolling admission is to APPLY EARLY, longer you wait, the less spots available and harder to get one.  I only started applying 3-4 weeks after I started the Program. I had a great resume back from applying to Optometry School and all I added was a Project section which was some Homework assignment that I did. Surprisingly I did not have to send that much applications out before receiving invites for interviews. I had a solid list of shadowing and various leadership experience. During my talk with recruiters, they were more interested in my soft skills and experience doing other things versus hard technical skills.

    ~30 Applications Sent
    3 Interview Invites
    2 Offers
    1 Rejection

The Offer I accepted was a Fortune 200 manufacturing company paying **$26 an hour**. I applied on their website and the Intern posting was for a Undergraduate student but I manage to score the Offer as a Master's student. During my time, I learn a lot of things. Such as Agile Method, Different Technology Stacks, Communicating with different Orgs, etc. I did a real life project and presented my finding to the entire Division.

To make it short, I received a great Performance review and met my OKR's but.......

I did not received a Full Time offer at the end of the Internship. Even though I did great and the other interns thought I would get one. They wanted someone to hit the ground running with more of an Statistic Background and the couple of courses in Statistics was not cutting it. I also didn't know back then what was a XGBoost or Random Forest was (now I know now lol). I was thinking they wanted someone as a Data Scientist which I definitely did not qualify for.

&#x200B;

# The Job Hunt and Offer

I was disappointed that I didn't receive a return offer but at least I had something that I could showcase on my resume, *Experience*. I started to apply for full time positions right after the Internship and oh boy that was a challenge. Took me 3 months of applying every week to finally receive a fulltime offer. I had an okay ratio for interview invites to application sent. Invites from anywhere from Consulting, Insurances, Retail, Healthcare, and Finance field. I applied mostly on LinkedIn, Company Website, and even the College Job Fairs.

    ~250-300+ Applications 
    7 Interview Invites
    2 Ghosted
    2 Declined
    1 Position Cancelled
    1 Rejection
    1 Offer Extended

I knew the economic slowdown and hiring freezes were not looking into my favor. This was my last semester of the Masters and the constant rejection had me a little depressed. One day, I was looking to see at a one particular Bank on the progress of my application of a job role I applied. I noticed there was a Data Analyst job posting the same day on Workday. Read the job description and I hit some basic qualifications (SQL, Six Sigma, Communication, etc.). I did not know what the hell was MicroStrategy or have coding experience in SAS but I apply anyway because I didn't have anything to lose.

A week later I received a call from HR and went trough 4 rounds of interview. I had great discussions with VP and a Manager. I tried to make the interview very conversational since I would be working with them directly. I think what stood out for me was my interest in the Financial Space. I had a interested in Stocks, Financial Market, and Personal Finance. We even talked about Charlie Munger and his ideologies. They also liked that I had experience taking something technical and reducing it down to some understandable from a nontechnical viewpoint. Also my experience talking with stakeholders was a big plus. My technical interview was a little joke compared to a Data Science Case interview I did with a Three Letter Consulting company that I absolutely bombed. They asked me What is a Where Clause, Explain a Subquery, What is a Difference between Inner/Right/Left Join and a Example. I would use mostly SQL which I was good at and they actually have learning cohorts onsite to teach me Python and SAS which was a big plus. 2 hours later on my fourth round, I received a phone call with an offer.

    $90k + Performance Bonus. Amazing Health + Wealth Benefits. 4 weeks PTO and 10 Sick Days. 

I did not negotiate because I didn't have any leverage and it was wayyy more than I was making now. I also dreamed of working in the Financial Market and will be in a Division involving the Global Market.

&#x200B;

# Final Thought and Future Plans

I would still recommend doing a Masters even with it's flaws. I know most Master program, such as this, are cash cows to make money for the School. Majority of my classmates were International Students paying full price and the other half are currently working and their company are paying for it.

I knew that I did not have the discipline to complete a Google Certification or DataCamp. Tuition was pricey but they gave me a 7% discount of tuition for a returning student (LMAO). Looking at past classmates LinkedIn, majority of them worked as Data Analyst and eventually as Data Scientist or Data Engineers.

If I would recommend anything, definitely have an outstanding resume, practice interviews, and communicate efficiently. I am a Introvert so I absolute hate doing Presentations and get anxious talking to people but it gets better slowly.

I know people would not recommend doing a Master's especially if you have no experience but at the end, it worked out for me. My future plan's is hopefully get into the Data Engineering field. I enjoy working with the databases and had a great relationship talking to the DE at the internship or even maybe a Sales Engineer lol.

Can one really become pretty proficient in these and *actually* break into data analytics without a related degree or entry level experience? I know learning these platforms would take a lot of time and dedication, which I’m willing to do.

r/dataanalysis will be going dark from 00:01 EST June 12th until June 15th.  We will evaluate the status of things going forward after that time.   

   
##What this means    
The subreddit will not be accessible to the public or to members of the subreddit during the time that it is dark.    


##Why are we doing this?    
We are taking the subreddit dark to support the protests against Reddit’s change in API policies.  As of this writing, over 3,600 subreddits will be taking part in the protest.   The change in API policies comes into effect on June 30th and are varied.  There are a number of problems with the changes, but a key factor is that Reddit is requiring app developers for apps large enough to be widely used to pay an extremely high amount.  The popular iOS app Apollo is an example.  By their calculations, their payments to Reddit are set to go from $0 to [nearly $2 million per month]( https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/).  It is an amount they have found unsustainable, and they will end service by June 30th.   Similar calculations are likely for most app developers.  The number seems designed to eliminate most or all third-party app developers from providing apps for Reddit.  Huge numbers of users find these apps preferable to Reddit’s own app.  Many moderators, particularly of large subreddits, do not believe that they can maintain the expectations that users have of moderators today without these third-party apps.  We hope that by participating in the protest we will contribute to a slowing of [the enshittification cycle]( https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/) as applied to Reddit.

m7jye1,dataanalysis,1616045315.0,"Hello all!

I'm currently exploring other career options. I got an advertisement on my google homepage for Google Certificates, checked it out, and signed up. I have very little experience with Data Analysis. I'm a 32 year-old American high school graduate with a basic understanding of Excel and Google Sheets, and had absolutely no prior knowledge of SQL, R, or really any aspects of what was involved in Data Analysis beyond what I read in job postings. ***I also want to say this is just my opinion so far, and my experience may not necessarily be the same for you.*** 

I signed up on March 14th. As of this post I have completed 4 courses (out of 8) in about ten hours. There are 8 courses in total, and each course is split into Weeks. The first week of the first course was so basic it frustrated my ADHD brain, ""So, what IS 'Data'?"" was a real question they answered... I know what data is. Everyone knows what data is. Right? But I sat through every second of every video. I did every journaling exercise, every quiz, etc., all the way through. And within an hour my first ""Week"" was finished. I moved onto the next ""Week"" of work. Then the next. I had finished the first month in about three hours, again, doing everything. At the end I figured, ""Ok, great, an intro for literally ANYONE!"" And I understood why the course started out as such. It was a bit frustrating and slow for me, but I moved on.

Then I started the second course: Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions. It was basically more of the same. It dealt with the subject of identifying and understanding how to figure out the right questions to solve given problems. But when I say it ""dealt with the subject"", that's pretty generous. Again, very generalized, very basic, to a shocking degree. I started skipping through videos and skimming the reading. I wanted to get to the REAL work. This pattern continued throughout the next two courses, albeit with some actual details on databases, SQL, and functions in Excel/Google Sheets in course 3 &4. Less than I'd hoped, but at a pace I feel anyone can follow.

In general the videos feel very... clinical. The speakers, can't figure out if they're actual actors or not, are hit or miss. But none so far are very compelling. The jokes are awful, but then that's not why we're here, and bad jokes are still funny for other reasons. I personally feel that if they update the course, they should focus on making these videos more informative and human. It's all a bit too stiff and corporate. I definitely enjoy that they have the entire transcript of the video available right underneath, though. You can click on a sentence and the video will play from that point, if you need. It makes for a fantastic option if for some reason you can watch but not listen for whatever reason. It's also great to skim the transcript to get the context of the video to see if it's worth your time if you want to move at an accelerated pace.

The ""Readings"" are probably the most informative portions to the coursework so far. Texts, charts, etc., about the subjects. Well written, clear, and concise, with good examples when necessary. Along with the glossaries I'd say this is the source of most of the true lesson.

There are these ""Journal"" portions I absolutely skip at this point. Personal reflections upon my goals aren't why I'm attempting to acquire this certificate. There's also discussion prompts which take you to the forums consisting of other participants in the coursework but I haven't participated yet. Once things get more difficult I'll dip my toe into that. Maybe.

The quizzes and tests are fine. They can be scenario based. There are links for you to download mock emails and datasheets to be able to answer the questions from the scenario, which I think is fantastic. Unfortunately, most of the time the answers are easily discerned without even looking at the mock data referenced in the question.  Most of the test questions are multiple choice, with the occasional ""Fill In The Blank"" type question. For example: ***""What is the correct LENGTH statement to use to find any text strings containing more than two characters? Type your answer below.""***

You can take quizzes repeatedly without penalty, and it keeps your highest score. Course tests however can only be taken 3 times without passing before you get an 8 hour timeout. I decided to explore how the testing works and there's a shocking lack of alternate questions, so often times you'll just get the same questions repeatedly if you didn't pass the first time. I'm unsure if that 8 hours starts ticking at the first attempt or the third... I'll check that out tomorrow maybe and edit this post. 

All in all, it's teaching a lot of extremely basic things, which I think is good, but I just don't feel challenged yet. I'm betting, and hoping, it'll ramp up in the coming courses. If you already have a basic understanding of what it means to be a Data Analyst, any knowledge of Excel/Google Sheets, and SQL, you'll breeze through even faster than I did. If you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING except how to read with basic comprehension skills, type, click a mouse, and do some basic math, this course is within your reach.

i4hqvn,dataanalysis,1596674908.0,"I've been subbed to this subreddit since I made the change full time into being a Data Analyst and I've noticed that there is a lot of focus on the technology, tools, languages, etc. I don't see a lot of information or questions regarding understanding the business or knowing how to add value outside of the standard workflow requests.

I come from an Accounting background mainly in 2 different sectors:

1. Financial

2. Manufacturing

I've worked in industries from banking to plastics, healthcare, agricultural equipment, truck trailer, automotive, etc. All of these business require radically different solutions and have hugely different questions regarding how to provide value to these respective organizations. No 2 companies in the same sector are going to have the same challenges. Just because 2 companies may be in the Energy sector, if one is fossil fuel (coal) and one is nuclear, you are going to have a totally different regulatory and compliance environment, expenses, metrics, etc.

Just about every department loops me into their meetings because management likes having a ""data expert"" in the room who can answer technical questions about using and reporting on the data. They also see the value in having someone who is curious about what goes on behind the scenes after the data is captured. I ask questions in every meeting about the data entry process, what data is important to who, what problems they are trying to solve, and what improvements their team has found so far and then what improvements I might be able to suggest. 

There needs to be a critical understanding of the company by the Analyst in how the company makes money, what its different lines of business are, who its major competitors are (peer group review), what challenges the business is currently facing or might be facing (COVID), and what improvements management thinks they can make to the company as a whole. It's important to have a sense of curiosity and interest in the business as well. Some of the questions I've asked and had discussions around performing analysis and trying to develop predictive analytics around are:

1. If our raw material costs at standard for a particular vehicle are $X and we have engineering changes that will change the BoM by $Y x 300,000 vehicles a year because of market demand, but will be equally offset in revenue, how do we explain the change in revenue estimations not only for next year's business plan, but also for our auditors as part of their revenue verification process AND verify the current take rates for that particular part on the model we produce now.

2. How can we accurately track inventory fluctuations (by part number) for RM, WIP, and FG items by matching them to our monthly production? IE inventory receipts, shop floor transactions and invoices. We also need to reduce inventory on hand by at least $1MM so we also need to develop an ongoing system to identify any unknown obsolete materials or slow moving materials we have on hand and track those accordingly so we can reserve appropriately.

3. We believe that the weights of the resins on our BoM's are off by at least 5%, we think they are too high and by adjusting the resin usage we can lower our material cost at standard. We need to collect weights, usage, and scrap on a sample of every molded part we make for this particular BoM configuration over the next 1-2 weeks. How can we prove that the changes we are proposing to make to the BoM will actually reduce our material cost at standard in the next 2 quarters and will not be offset as losses in inventory adjustments? What statistical analysis can we do to prove our theory correct regarding BoM weights?

4. Compared to our competitors we are the lowest performing company in regards to revenue generated in this particular business line. We need to understand what revenue we are generating, where it's coming from, where we have inefficiencies and what we can do to increase revenue in the markets we serve for this particular product. How can we pull together a comprehensive overview by product, region, salesperson, month (last 6 quarters), and any trends associated with those criteria?

These are just a small snippet of some of the business challenges that I've had to work with multiple different departments in the company with to solve. Yes, knowing how to access the data and using SQL to query it and Excel to build pivot tables and pivot charts or power BI to build interactive dashboards with drill-throughs or Python to create SPA's for management to review the KPI's are all important and definitely part of the job, but I just don't see a lot of focus on answering the business questions that management is trying to solve and that I think needs to be a pivotal focus because if I'm interviewing with a company I want management to know that I can add value from day one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/i4hqvn/i_think_that_focusing_on_the_technology_part_of/,"I think that focusing on the technology part of the job is great, but there needs to be an understanding of the business as well and how we as the analysts can add value to just about every department within the company",55,13,0.96

jce4qp,dataanalysis,1602869157.0,"tldr: I Used a three month lockdown to study data analysis, and was able to apply it to my job with the military. 

I work for the military, so this will be a little vague, but maybe someone will read this and see that you don't have to know everything to start doing useful analysis. I also kind of want to brag a little.

I was locked down for three months due to COVID and decided to study data analysis. I signed up for some online training, and downloaded a book on Pandas, and a couple of books on Python.

When I went back to work, I had some free time, so I started doing some ETL stuff. The military unit I work for uses Excel for everything, and I was able to make something useful out of the 15,000+ lines. The information and graphs were included in a report to the commanding general, and will be included in monthly reports from now on. 

I kept at it, and was able to start looking at ways to identify trends in certain activity. I noticed a steep decline in one area, and let the lead intel analyst know. I told him that we would have to explain the trend. He looked into it, and was able to explain the decline. The next day the general asked about that exact thing. Because I had brought it to the analyst's attention, he was able to answer the general's question on the spot. 

The total amount of code is about 1000 lines, and I know that are some huge inefficiencies, but I'm working on it. 

Things I learned:

1- Even though I could do the exercises in the training, when it came time to work on real data, I was almost completely lost. The main thing I got from the training was an understanding of what's possible. I had to go back and look up how to do most things. There was just too much hand-holding in the training. 

2 - It's okay to steal code, but you have to understand what it does. The code to identify trends was taken from stackoverflow, but I had to modify it to do what I needed, and then be able to explain what it was doing before anyone else agreed to at least kind of trust it. 

3 - More on stealing code: I had to understand the code in order to modify it. The code as written did not exactly fit my needs.

4 - This shit is fun.

5 - Don't skip the data munging. The Excel spreadsheets have misspellings, inconsistent spellings, spaces at the end, and missing data. 

6 - It isn't just about the data. I had a little bit of programming experience, but in order to really make something useful, I needed to understand the Python as well. 

7 - This post got a lot longer than I had planned, but I'm celebrating my birthday in a country that may or may not allow alcohol, so I may or may not be drinking illegally.

8 - You're going to run into things you didn't learn from the training. For example, I have to reindex by day, but that doesn't include days where no data was entered.

We don't have to be formal and don't have to chat constantly. I know everyone is busy with their lives, so we'll just leave a message to each other or set a time to chat. We can talk about what we're learning, and how we learned it, ask questions, do trivia or quizzes to check our skills, come up with project ideas, and even do projects together to put them in our resumes! (As I've mentioned I'm looking for people around the same level as me, so we can relate to each other's struggles without worrying about looking stupid lol) I think it'll be more personal than asking questions on Reddit. 

Looking forward to gain hands-on skills, improve our knowledge, and collaborate on projects!

11blobr,dataanalysis,1677333630.0,"I am about done with my capstone project in the final course of the Google Analytics Certification Process. I was a Planning and Analysis Manager a decade ago and took the course to get back into being a Data Analyst after a decade in marketing, martial arts, travel, and other projects. I found that my personality and skillset are best suited for working more on my own as an analyst.

I took the course to brush up on my skills and learn new ones. I watched a number of Youtube videos on how great the course is for getting into Data Analytics. Most of those videos have affiliate marketing links and aren't an unbiased take on the course and many of the people making reviews likely didn't take the course.

Here are some of my thoughts and observations.

The course says it takes 240 hours to complete. I think it could be done in 80 to 100 hours while watching all the videos in each course, doing the learning logs, practice problems, and capstone. If you are a college student on break, just bite the bullet and knock it out in 2 to 3 weeks. If you are a full-time professional, put in 10 hours a week and knock it out in 2 months.

If you are new to data analysis, the background, thought process, how to present findings, ideas, and career advice are very helpful. You can get much of the same advice from other online sources as well. If you have experience, you are basically doing the course for the certificate and picking up some new tricks and tips.

The technical aspects on Excel are solid. The Tableau, SQL and R are very basic. Anybody who takes the course as a beginner will need to learn a lot more Tableau, Excel, SQL, R or Python in order to really prepare themselves for a data analyst role. Also, depending on field, AWS, Salesforce, Google Analytics Tags, etc.

I have seen some people on here post their gripes about the course. Its a great start, almost like a Data Analytics 101 class, but then you have to challenge yourself to take the 200, 300 and 400 level classes in Tableau, Python, R, SQL, and Excel to build upon that foundation. Networking and building a portfolio are important as well. As you learn something new in SQL, or tableau take on a new project while the learning is fresh and pop it up on your portfolio.

The certificate and course aren't a silver bullet or magical. Its just the initial foundation that will require a lot more time, energy and work to learn, build a portfolio, networking, and apply for jobs. Its just the start, not even close to the finish.

Also, I looked at the job postings within the Google Data Analytics job site. Most of the jobs aren't entry level and a number of them require Bachelors or Masters in STEM fields.

From my understanding they're SQL, Tableau/PowerBI, Python/R, and Excel/Sheets.    
I know you don't necessarily need to be a *master* with all of them, but just wanted some insight as to how much I would need to be comfortable with before applying and/or how much can be learned once I have the position. 

Can anyone give a rough estimate on what should be known from each of these categories before applying? I'll list where I'm at with each below if anyone has any insight on that as well. 

* I completed the Google Data Analysis course. From what I understand it doesn't really hold that much weight, but was a good starting point as someone coming from a completely different field. 
I also have a lot of the soft skills that seem to be wanted. Communication, working with a team, things like that. 

* Sheets - I took a 'course' for Google Sheets that focused on things that would be used for data analysis. I say 'course' because it was just a youtube learning series, so not able to write something like ""Completed XYZ Excel Data Analysis Course"". I feel pretty comfortable using it to manipulate/clean data. 

* SQL - I'm currently about midway through the Mosh SQL course. I am familiar with the basics of SQL including joins, and the basic clauses/operators. I've also gone though Stratascratch and done almost all of the 'easy' interview questions. Then will start working on the 'medium' ones. 

* Tableau - I use Tableau public and have taken sample datasets and created basic visualizations and dashboards. They're not fancy, just basic graphs, but I can easily explain what they are and what they mean as a whole. I am not familiar at all using PowerBI. 

* Python/R - No experience at all.

## ""How do I get into data analysis?"" Questions

Rather than have 100s of separate posts, each asking for individual help and advice, please post your questions. This thread is for questions asking for individualized career advice:

-   _“How do I get into data analysis?”_ as a job or career.
-   _“What courses should I take?”_ 
-   _“What certification, course, or training program will help me get a job?”_
-   _“How can I improve my resume?”_
-   _“Can someone review my portfolio / project / GitHub?”_
-   _“Can my degree in …….. get me a job in data analysis?”_
-   _“What questions will they ask in an interview?”_

Even if you are new here, you too can offer suggestions. So if you are posting for the first time, look at other participants’ questions and try to answer them. It often helps re-frame your own situation by thinking about problems where you are not a central figure in the situation.

This doesn’t exclude you from making a detailed post about _how **you** got a job doing data analysis_. It’s great to have examples of how people have achieved success in the field.

It also does not prevent you from creating a post to _share your data and visualization projects_. Showing off a project in its final stages is permitted and encouraged.

When applying for jobs, some online applications ask for linkedin profile url. Again, would these datacamp certs be worth placing on your linkedin and resume since it 'proves' that I know SQL joins as well as just general visibility for recruiters for example or should I just leave this off since it does not count for actual real world experience, etc.?

I recently landed a job working as an analyst! Part of my job requires me to do a very repetitive, and boring task that I have a feeling can be done more efficiently, but I can’t quite figure out what to do here.

Basically I have to go through client requests that are asking to add a certain person / location to our database which holds all of our existing clients. 

My current process is to download the client requests in an excel file that shows the name, address, city, phone number etc. I then cross reference these request with our existing database using SSMS, if the request is something we already have in our system, I provide the ID that the client falls under. Otherwise I will verify that the new location / person being fits all of the criteria needed, and then add it into our database.

Like I mentioned, I have a feeling this can be automated but don’t know where to start, I’m open to any and all suggestions.

The certifications I currently have are:  
Tableau Desktop Specialist   
Google Data Analytics Professional   
Microsoft Office Associate  
Microsoft Office Expert  
DP-900 Microsoft Certified Azure Data Fundamentals  


I've been using datacamp to learn all the tools, I feel pretty comfortable with excel, tableau, and SQL and now just looking to take the Dp-300 and PL-300 to prove SQL and PowerBI respectively and by the time I'm done likely by next month I'll be comfortable with all tools involved.  


That being said I don't have any projects or work experience, should I pivot more to focus on projects and not invest so heavily in certs? I know they certainly won't land me a job but my thought is it's enough to catch a recruiter's eye to read more on my resume.  


So will just my certifications be enough to get me something entry level or should I look at creating projects alongside the certs and what would be some best practices in completing that (Is it okay for me to reuse a dataset for a handful of projects, should I write a brief document explaining my process in sourcing, cleaning, and processing data for visualization?)

13855hv,dataanalysis,1683246466.0,"Hi, I'm just ranting here and would appreciate any words of support

I'm a recent grad from a T20 college that specializes in STEM, think Caltech or MIT level. I majored in math and CS and gradually realized I absolutely hate coding. Technology is just not that interesting to me, and I dislike the culture and am not good at it. That's why I'm not a software engineer, and I don't intend on trying, so I don't need ""it's just impostor syndrome"" or ""just try harder, it takes time."" I simply know it's not a good fit for me. Honestly, I just love the humanities and wish I majored in linguistics and psychology. But anyways...

After graduation, I did a bit of nonprofit work and recruiting and marketing work. I was terminated from the latter job though, and as you may know, talent acquisition jobs are getting slaughtered right now.

So I got a data analyst job. I'm OK with it tbh. I still like math for the most part, and it doesn't involve excessive or the hard type of coding. It's not what I really feel passionate about, but it is what it is. I just still feel insecure though because I feel like data analysts aren't that respected or impressive to people. I know this is kinda dumb to think, but just coming from a T20 school, everyone around me is making so much more than me and have fancier titles like engineer or data scientist or product/project manager or whatever. In high school, everyone thought I was like a genius or something, and now I see people who weren't ""ranked as high"" doing better jobs than me. I don't want them to think I had so much potential and then just squandered it. Data analysts don't seem to be that prestigious or paid that well. Honestly, it's about the same as what I made in my recruiting/marketing job even though data analysis seems much harder.

I guess my question is do data analysts actually garner quite a bit of respect from people? I could be just in the wrong circles, but I feel like people think data analysts are run of the mill and substantially less impressive than an engineer or data scientist or PM like I said.

Lot of people asking about IBM and google data analytics courses and if they can get a job after completion, etc, etc...Those courses giving you certificate of completion which has absolutely no value, maybe you learn some basics in there, but that's it, I wouldn't place it in my CV.Certification in the other hand is a different thing, you can't cheat there (at least easily) and you can't get certified without actually knowing data analytics basics well and a tool you are getting certified in, for example Power BI or Tableau.Unlike coursera's more than less useless ""certificates"", certified Tableau data analyst or/and Microsoft certified Power BI data analyst giving you real knowledge and it's great to put in your CV, not as good as a degree in related field and experience working as a data analyst, but far better than some random projects and useless courseras courses.

Projects are good thing but as I said, everyone can build, maybe cheat little bit and steal some code, that's why recruiters looking for a certificates that is not easy to get without you knowing data analytics. (Degree is still best thing you can have, but certainly possible to get a job without degree if you are good enough)

At last, we all know that Excel very important, you don't really need any certification or anything like that, you just have to be really really good at it.

SQL and python are great skills to have, you will probably get SQL questions on a job interview so you have to be somewhat decent in that.

Python is the most important skill, for starting maybe being okay level is good enough, but in my opinion sooner you master python is better, because once you master python you can only focus on one tool, you can do basically everything in python, you gonna use some viz tool rarely and that's it, once you become comfortable working in python, I think you are good to go, there is not much data entry level jobs available so that's it, there is loads of seniors applying for data entry level jobs, that's why you need to have somewhat equal knowledge of tools at least to land a job.There is 230% more job seekers with degree than actual jobs available in this field, not to mention the job seekers without degree, so in order to have a real chance, real knowledge is only thing you can show recruiters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/146texn/difference_between_certification_and_certificate/,Difference between certification and certificate of completion,47,30,0.96

As you begin your journey to becoming a data analyst, mastering SQL (Structured Query Language) is a fundamental skill that will open doors to new opportunities and propel your career forward. SQL is a critical skill for data analysts, and its importance is reflected in the hiring process. According to a study by [Burning Glass Technologies](https://fsc.stevens.edu/burning-glass/), SQL was listed as one of the top skills required for data analyst roles, with approximately 70-80% of job postings emphasizing SQL proficiency. SQL (Structured Query Language) is like the bread and butter of data analysis and being well-versed in SQL is essential for success in this field. But how do you prepare for the SQL interview battlefield and conquer the query game with confidence?

Whether you're a data analyst, a software developer, or someone who needs to work with data, SQL is a valuable skill to have. It empowers you to extract valuable information from databases, perform calculations, and gain insights to drive informed decision-making. 

In this blog, we'll explore some of the top SQL questions frequently asked during data analyst interviews. So, let's dive right in.

## What is SQL? 

SQL, aka Structured Query Language, is a language used to communicate with and manage databases. Imagine a database as a digital warehouse where you store and organize your data. SQL acts as the ""**language**"" that allows you to interact with this warehouse and perform various tasks. Many popular database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, support SQL, making it a universal language for interacting with databases.

In simple terms, SQL is like a set of instructions or commands that you give to a database to retrieve, modify, or analyze data. It helps you ask questions about your data and get meaningful answers. For example, you can use SQL to retrieve specific information from a database, filter data based on certain conditions, calculate sums or averages, sort data in a specific order, or even update and delete data.

Just think of SQL as a bridge between you and the database. You write SQL statements, which are essentially lines of code, and the database understands and executes those statements to carry out the desired actions. It's like speaking a language that both you and the database understand.

## SQL For Data Analyst Interviews 

When it comes to data analyst interviews, SQL is often a crucial topic of discussion. Interviewers use SQL questions to assess your proficiency in working with databases, querying data, and performing data analysis tasks. Here are some common areas of SQL that you may encounter in data analyst interviews:

1. **Basic SQL Queries:** You can expect questions that test your understanding of basic SQL syntax and your ability to write simple SELECT statements to retrieve data from a table. Interviewers may ask you to retrieve specific columns, apply filters using WHERE clauses, sort data using ORDER BY, and limit the number of results using LIMIT or TOP.
2. **Joins:** Since data analysis often involves combining data from multiple tables, employers may evaluate your knowledge of different types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) and your ability to write join queries. Understanding how to match related data across tables is crucial for performing comprehensive analysis.
3. **Aggregation and Grouping:** Data analysts frequently use aggregated data to derive insights. Questions related to aggregation and grouping test your familiarity with aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX) and the GROUP BY clause. You may be asked to calculate summary statistics, perform group-wise analysis, or filter aggregated results using the HAVING clause.
4. **Subqueries:** Subqueries are nested queries within another query. Interviewers may assess your ability to write and utilize subqueries effectively. You may encounter questions where you need to use subqueries to retrieve specific subsets of data or perform calculations based on intermediate results.
5. **Data Manipulation:** Data analysts often need to modify data as part of their analysis. Questions related to data manipulation may include inserting new records, updating existing records, deleting data, or altering table structures. Demonstrating proficiency in these operations showcases your ability to prepare and cleanse data for analysis.
6. **Database Design and Optimization:** Data analysts may be involved in designing efficient databases and optimizing query performance. Interviewers may ask questions about normalization, denormalization, indexing strategies, or techniques to optimize slow-performing queries. Understanding how to structure databases for optimal performance proves your knowledge of best practices in data management.

It's important to not only have a theoretical understanding of these SQL concepts but also be comfortable applying them in practical scenarios. Now let’s explore the common SQL questions you may encounter during your interview.

## Top SQL Interview Questions For Data Analysts  

**Q 1) What is SQL, and why is it important in data analysis?**

SQL stands for Structured Query Language, a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It provides a standardized approach to connecting databases, making extracting, analyzing, and altering data easier. As a data analyst, SQL allows you to create queries that retrieve and transform data, allowing you to derive useful insights from big datasets.

**Q 2) What are the different types of SQL commands you are familiar with?**

SQL commands can be broadly categorized into four types:

* Data Definition Language (DDL): Used to define and manage the structure of a database (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
* Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used to manipulate the data within the database (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
* Data Control Language (DCL): Used to control the access and permissions for the database (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).
* Transaction Control Language (TCL): Used to manage transactions in the database (e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

**Q 3) What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?**

* INNER JOIN retrieves records that have matching values in both tables being joined. It returns only the intersection of the two tables based on the specified condition. On the other hand, OUTER JOIN retrieves all records from one table and the matching records from the other table. There are generally 3 types of OUTER JOIN:

1. LEFT JOIN: Retrieves all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table.
2. RIGHT JOIN: Retrieves all records from the right table and the matching records from the left table.
3. FULL JOIN: Retrieves all records when a match is in either the left or right table.

**Q 4) How do you handle NULL values in SQL?**

NULL represents the absence of a value in SQL. When dealing with NULL values, you can use the following techniques:

* IS NULL: Checks if a value is NULL.
* IS NOT NULL: Checks if a value is not NULL.
* COALESCE: Returns the first non-NULL value from a list of values.
* NULLIF: Compares two expressions and returns NULL if they are equal; otherwise, returns the first expression.

**Q 5) What is the difference between GROUP BY and HAVING clauses?**

GROUP BY is used to group rows based on one or more columns and is generally used with aggregate functions, including SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc. It creates subsets of data based on the grouping columns. HAVING, on the other hand, is used to filter the grouped data depending on the conditions that are given. It is similar to the WHERE clause; however, it only applies to grouped data.

**Q 6) How do you optimize the performance of a slow SQL query?**

To optimize the performance of a slow SQL query, you can consider the following methods:

* Use proper indexing on columns used in the query's WHERE and JOIN clauses.
* Avoid using SELECT \* and, instead, specify only the required columns.
* Use appropriate JOIN types based on the relationships between tables.
* Minimize the use of subqueries and use JOINs instead.
* Break down complex queries into smaller, manageable steps using temporary tables or CTEs (Common Table Expressions).
* Analyze and optimize the query execution plan using tools like EXPLAIN or Query Analyzer.
* Check the database statistics are accurate and up-to-date
* Avoid using functions or calculations in the WHERE clause that could prevent index usage.
* Consider partitioning large tables to enhance query performance.
* Optimize the server's hardware resources, such as memory and disk configurations.

**Q 7) How can you sort the result of a query in descending order?**

To sort the result of a query in descending order, you can use the ORDER BY clause followed by the DESC keyword. For example:

**SELECT** column1, column2  
**FROM** table\_name  
**ORDER** **BY** column1 **DESC**;

This will retrieve the data from the table and sort it based on column1 in descending order.

For detailed information, you can refer to a Data Analyst Course Online, and get trained by MNC experts. 

### Q 8) What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause?

The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on one or more columns in order to perform aggregate functions on each group. It is mostly used in conjunction with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc. The result shows a set of rows where each row represents a unique combination of values from the grouped columns.

### Q 9)  How do you handle duplicates in a result set?

To handle duplicates in a result set, you can use the DISTINCT keyword in the SELECT statement. It eliminates duplicate values and returns only the unique values. For example:

**SELECT** **DISTINCT** column1, column2  
**FROM** table\_name;

This will retrieve distinct combinations of values from column1 and column2.

**Q 10) What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key?**

A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It ensures data integrity and is used as a reference by foreign keys in other tables. A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables and enforces referential integrity.

**Q 11) How to calculate the total number of records in a table?**

You can use the COUNT function to calculate the total number of records in a table. Here's an example:

**SELECT** COUNT(\*) **AS** total\_records **FROM** table\_name;

This will return the total number of records in the specified table.

**Q 12) What is a subquery, and how is it different from a regular query?** 

A subquery, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query embedded within another query. It is used to retrieve data based on the results of another query. However, the major difference between a subquery and a regular query is that a subquery is enclosed within parentheses and is often used within the WHERE or HAVING clauses to filter data based on specific conditions.

13hfhue,dataanalysis,1684079025.0,"Just signed up for a free trial for LinkedIn Premium and every single data analyst job I applied for, (entry level and junior data analyst jobs) sample size of roughly 30, shows that the % of applicants wielding a master's is around 45-55% while bachelors is 30-35%. I'm in Canada and 2021 census data shows that 33% of adult pop has a BA while only 8% has Master's. I'm not sure if it means that in total, only 33% have a Bachelor's or it's actually 33+8 = 41% of the adult population have a BA but from the census and common sense, the # of people with a BA/BS far outnumbers those with an MA.

None of the job descriptions asked for an advanced degree. None of them even hint at one (ie. asking for deep statistical knowledge etc.) But every single job shows that there are more MA applicants and on avg, they outnumber BA/BS by a good 10-15 pct points. Of course, LinkedIn data is exceptionally noisy. But when the numbers are that far off....

Only reasons I can think of are that there are a lot of bot accounts, Twitter (used to), FB and other social media have tons of bots. Some jobs displayed that a good 10-15% of applicants had an MBA, which may have been added to the totals of jobs that didn't differentiate between an MA and MBA. I heard that literally anyone could get an MBA and only the ones from top B schools actually even matter. Some MBAs are only 1 yr programs, so I assume employers would probably put less weight into an MBA. Could it be that people with Master's are a bunch of nerds that lack soft skills to get a job so they thought getting an MA will allow them to one-up the competition and hence they are disproportionately unemployed and actively job hunting? Or worse, are people that desperate and lie about their education? Pretty sure employers could verify it very easily.

I can't compete in a credential dick measuring contest, so the question is: do hiring managers prefer those overeducated candidates (though they didn't ask for it in the job description) or do I need to join this arms race? I feel like I've read countless articles over the years ""is the Master's the new Undergrad?"" I've tailored my skillset (Tableau, Excel, SQL (used some window functions for what it's worth), Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, bit of SciPy)). I've a BA in Economics, have done a course in Stats, and two in Econometrics. I have less than one year of actual work experience in an analyst role. What else could they possibly ask of me? Some jobs want R, but Python is close enough, maybe I should just lie and put R on my resume, lest ATS throws it into the trash for not having that keyword? And do I need to learn CRM software, such as Salesforce, or could an employer tolerate that I learn it on the job? I can't help but feel that some may be holding out for a unicorn candidate that fits 100% of job description and then offer him a shit salary, and not have to train him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/13hfhue/linkedin_job_applicants_with_masters_outnumbering/,LinkedIn job applicants with Master's outnumbering Bachelor's?

I am a person who is good writing code and good at math, but it seems everytime I try to present information, it's a living hell trying to make the information look good.

The main purpose of my book is to build **an intuitive understanding** of how algorithms work through basic examples. In order to understand the presented material, it is enough to know basic mathematics and linear algebra.

After reading this book, you will know the basics of supervised learning, understand complex mathematical models, understand the entire pipeline of a typical ML project, and also be able to share your knowledge with colleagues from related industries and with technical professionals.

And for those who find the theoretical part not enough - I supplemented the book with a repository on **GitHub**, which has Python implementation of every method and algorithm that I describe in each chapter ([https://github.com/5x12/themlsbook](https://github.com/5x12/themlsbook)).

After couple of months of self learning, finally got my first position as a Junior Data Analyst.

The only folks who are part of the Data team are Data Engineers / Scientists since they work on transversal projects (that’s how they explain that) 

It’s difficult because I am the only DA (on top of that Junior) in my team and I feel like I am disturbing people (Data guys) from other teams when I need an advice. They don’t really know my data/tables and it’s always difficult to interact with them about my struggles. 

Moreover, as I am the only Junior DA in my team, I take dozens of requests every time and I just can’t handle everything. It’s a good learning curve, but sometimes I don’t even feel legitimate enough to refuse/challenge their ideas, since the requests come from the management. 

I feel overwhelmed even though I feel I can do it and have the competencies to do my work, but I just struggle and feel constant stress. There is nobody to challenge my data modeling practices / my code etc. I am just delivering something that works.

otun9m,dataanalysis,1627553469.0,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

So a little background on me. I'm 29 years old, getting close to 30. I'm not happy at all with where my life is at right now, stuck at a retail job slinging out coffee to busy professionals. I've stumbled upon this role through my countless hours of researching jobs in tech, and it stuck out to me because I felt like it ticked a lot of boxes for what I'm naturally inclined and interested in. Plus, it did not feel as coding heavy as supposed to a web developer. I get that some of you may laugh at that last statement.

I get that coding will be a part of it, maybe even a large part of it, but it does not seem like it's the bread and butter of what a data analyst needs compared to an actual coder.

Anyways, let's get straight to the point. As the title states, I have no background in this field. I have a degree in art and painting and have taken no statistics or mathematical course ever during my time in college.

Currently, I'm working through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, hoping this can open some doors for me once I get it. However,  I'm fully aware that a young newly minted college grad with a degree in CS or DA, is still going be a way more attractive option than a 30 year old with a certificate.

In addition, to taking the Google DA course, I'm learning as much as I can about Excel and SQL through YouTube videos, Khan Academy, Coursera, etc.

My current skill stack I would say is:

Excel: Beginner to Lower Intermediate

SQL: Beginner

Python: Beginner

Tablue: Only just started

&#x200B;

I'm desperate to get out of retail, but I would love to get at least a small taste of the data world. I know I will never be able to get an actual Data Analyst role now, but is there a role below DA that I can potentially get into? I've been looking at Data Entry roles, though I'm not sure if that is relevant? Plus, that job in specific is disappearing fast since entry is easy to automate.

If there is no entry into the field as of now, then I would love some recommendations as to what else I need to learn to supplement my certificate. Will I need more than the four skills I've outlined previously? Lastly, one thing similar to the art world that Data Analytics has in common, is having a portfolio. Can certain Excel projects be used to demonstrate my skills and be a part of my portfolio during interviews? Or, are we talking about well laid out dashboards, or perhaps SQL databases that may be more impressive?

tnefdx,dataanalysis,1648184069.0,"Hello, all!

My name is Keaton, and I'm 32, American, and a male. I have a bachelor's degree from an American university, but it is not in a tech-related field. In January of this year, I started to pivot myself toward a career change. I've been working in education for the past 10+ years, and I've really enjoyed it, but my time in this space is coming to an end. I've been living and working abroad for the past 2.5 years, but this summer (2022), I think I'm finally planning on coming home and changing careers. I'd like to transition into the tech space. Based on what I've read and learned, my biggest areas of interest are data analysis, full-stack web development, and cybersecurity. So far, I've mainly focused on the first two areas as I don't feel that I'm ready to tackle learning cybersecurity, and I definitely find myself favoring data analysis over full-stack web development. The learning path seems much clearer to me, and I find it more interesting overall. Also, I think a lot of my soft skills, including critical thinking, research, presentation, and project planning, will translate well into data analysis.

Here's my current learning plan. I'm trying to get a solid foundation in the skill/knowledge area before moving on to the next one:

1). SQL

2). Spreadsheets

3). Visualization Tools

4). General Theory/Statistics

5). Python

6). R

To this end, I'm using a few resources, including Coursera, Datacamp, W3, and FreeCodeCamp (among others). Of these sources, I'm really enjoying Datacamp. They have many courses, all of which are approximately 4-5 hours in length, that cover plenty of topics with exercises included. They also have projects, which I plan on diving into once my skills are up to par. Datacamp recently offered a year-long subscription at a discount of more than 50%, so I pulled the trigger.

Anyway, I'm reaching out to see if anyone is interested in partnering up with me, primarily for projects and for sharing resources and for job hunting, over the next 6-18 months. As of right now, I don't feel project-ready -- I think I'll need a few more months of self-study -- but I'm fully committed to completing them and adding them to my portfolio. Please note that I do work a full-time job, so at most, I can commit 2-3 hours per day to data analysis. Also, I live in Asia, so my time zone is 12-15 hours ahead of the U.S.

As with anything, I think it would be easier to work with others who are equally motivated. Whether you are an aspiring data analyst like me or someone with experience in the space, please let me know if you'd be interested. Perhaps we could create a Discord or something and work from there? I think a group of 3-5 people would be ideal, but I'm open-minded. Who knows -- maybe all of us will even become good life-long friends?

My personal interests are myriad -- gaming, exercise, education, sports, entertainment (e.g. comic books, films, t.v. shows), music, languages, personal finance, and many more -- so if we share any interests and we could create a project around one or more of them, that'd be great!

Anyway, thanks for reading. I hope to hear from some of you, either in comments below or in my message inbox!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for all of the positive feedback and responses. I've read all of them and taken into account what was said. Based on what I've read, I've made TWO (2) decisions.

(1). Someone mentioned a Discord community called Dataxp ([https://www.dataxp.ai/](https://www.dataxp.ai/)). I joined this community and realized that it's better and more comprehensive than anything that I could hope to make. Therefore, I encourage all of you to join this group.

(2). That being said, if any of you are still interested in partnering in a smaller Discord group to share learning resources, discuss projects/portfolios, network, and collaborate, I still made a server. I'm NOT a Discord expert and don't have a lot of time to research how to create the best possible server, so the server won't have a lot of bells and whistles, but it should serve for now. If interest/activity grows, I'll put more work into maintaining it.

zrb01s,dataanalysis,1671599243.0,"Get ready for a long one guys as I want to lay out my journey from starting in this field and how I did it to hopefully help you all in your job search as well.

Background:

I think I may have a bit of a different background to most posts I've seen looking for help on this sub, but not by any means unique. I graduated college in the beginning of 2011 with a degree in Business Management with a focus in Finance, specifically business valuation and investments. Out of college I struggled to get a job in the field of that degree so opted to enter an industry I love, automotive in this case. I started working an retailer and quickly worked my way up at the store level and stayed there for nearly a decade. A better opportunity came up at a local dealership and I held both a sales and service role there until the pandemic started, when I was laid off. At that time my first child was just a few months old so this, in a way, was a blessing in disguise and gave me the opportunity to stay at home with them. Throughout my time at home I knew I would eventually need to go back to the workplace as the kids (we had a second), grew up and would end up going to school/daycare. I reverted back to some of the things that interested me in college which was the valuation part of my degree and using programs like R and Excel to come to conclusions. As I researched options, DA came up quite often and I decided to take advantage of the Google Data Analytics course and see how it peaked my interest.

Data Analyst Process:

Upon completion, my interest was most definitely peaked and I started to apply for jobs and continue taking some of the other courses to polish and expand on my skills. I was spending anywhere from three to four, to as much as 8 hours a day practicing and working on the courses I was taking, while again, constantly applying for jobs. As I was working through, I was consuming YT content on how to brake into this career field and learned quite a few things. Optimizing your LinkedIn profile and resume were key in my case. I was about to shift from coursework to building a portfolio when I started getting approached by some recruiters through LinkedIn, some of which were bogus or had very poor reviews. Being that this part started in early November, the process was quite slow due to the upcoming holiday and that some of the legit offers were companies in which the year-end holiday's were their ""busy season"". So for context, the opportunity I took, my initial contact with the recruiter was early to mid November, and I just accepted the offer today, and it is a bit above the average pay range.

Conclusion:

My biggest piece of advice is, if you are serious about this career and are passionate about the work you will be doing, NOT the pay, keep at it and continue to practice and learn new skills, and don't be complacent with your image in the career networking space.  Continually evolve and take in new advice and information to better present yourself to employers. In my case, I applied to over 170-180 jobs according to my log, which I'm sure I didn't include some. I would say I officially began my job search in early August of this year, so it does take time if you are also in a career shift like I am. There were a couple opportunities I passed on because they were a great fit for the season of life I'm in, but as much as you can, don't sacrifice or cut yourself short too much when considering an offer. If it's not right, it's not right.

Lastly, regardless of your previous experience, find a way to relate it to Data Analysis. Use and practice the STAR method on in your resume and in interviews. If you don't know, in general, it means 'what was the problem, what was your approach, and what were the results. Even if you don't think the first call you get is the right fit, use it as a chance to practice your interview skills. You can always say ""No"".

I hope this helps one of you out there. Special thanks to a lot of you who got their shot before me and made a post like this discussing their experience. It was a big help and made me think differently as I hadn't had to look for a job in nearly 15 years.

uw313n,dataanalysis,1653320267.0,"In my 10+ years of work-life involved with data, there have been two pain points for me. First, there is no tool for everyone in a company who wants quickly get answers by themselves. Excel is familiar to almost everyone, but the data size limit, data accessibility, organization of transformations, and collaboration capability are not good enough. Second,  the data team is exhausted by the shit mountain of the SQL and other data transformation codes. Besides, the unclear requirements in emails, talking, and documents from business teams also are dragging down the data team. They have no time to do more valuable work such as improving infrastructures, data quality, data governance, etc.

Last year, my best friends and I started building a data tool that everyone could access and deal with large datasets (up to GB-level by now) without technical support in a spreadsheet-like UI. And our tool organizes the data transformations in a clear and self-expressed way.. Moreover, our product can automatically translate the data transformations to SQL compatible with many databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.

Would anyone be interested in giving it a spin? We have upgraded the product several times based on our initial test users' suggestions and got positive feedback from a big company in real and complex use cases. Now, we want to get more advice and feedback.

\---------------------------------------

If you’re new to Data Analysis… Welcome! Glad you have you :).

People learn data analysis skills in different ways. Maybe you’ve done some courses, tutorials, certifications or even a whole degree. You’re either working on creating a portfolio or you’ve received your very first dataset and real world questions to answer  – congratulations!

At this point, it can be totally normal to think: 

>*“Ok, how do I begin analysing this dataset? How exactly am I supposed to start? Help!”*

Cue some mild panic and hint of existential dread.

I’ve seen many a reddit-thread where people feel lost without the structure of learning material to guide them. It can be easy to feel like you’re not making any progress in your learning when you stumble at the very start of applying your knowledge in the real world. 

When you first receive a dataset outside of a structured course, it can be really confusing about where to start because you could start anywhere, and you could head in any direction. 

>*Don’t worry – you’ve got this!*

Whatever training you’ve had up until now will move you forward in your analysis. What I’ll help you with today is not Step 1 of your analysis, but what I think of as Step 0 – Getting to know your dataset. 

It’s tempting to dive straight into analyses because it feels like it’s the “real work” but rest-assured, getting to know your dataset IS real work and will pay off massively in steering your analyses to useful results. You’ll be able to provide others with guidance on what questions can or can’t be answered and you’ll have a better idea of how to interpret the results. 

What I’ll present you with here is a checklist of ways in which you can get to know the dataset you’re working with. Take this with you in your first, fiftieth or hundred-and-fiftieth analysis – it’ll always work. The more you can check off, the better your understanding of the data and analyses will be. As you gain experience a lot of this will become second nature. 

The basis of this approach is to give you a solid mental reference point of the data and will be your first mental model of what it represents. Once you’ve got this reference point, you’ll feel a lot more confident about what step 1 of your analysis should be. It’s like finding a landmark in an unfamiliar part of town and suddenly you have a better idea about where you are and what direction you should be going.

Once you’ve got this reference point, you’ll feel a lot more confident about what step 1 of your analysis should be. It’s like finding a landmark in an unfamiliar part of town and suddenly you have a better idea about where you are and what direction you should be going. 

Use the table of contents below as a checklist and then read on for more detailed descriptions of each.

* Storage format
* File size (kB, MB, GB)
* Number of rows and columns
* Data types
* Quick scan of first 10 rows
* Age of dataset and how often it’s updated
* Purpose of the dataset
* Who uses it now?
* How was the data collected?
* For databases, where is the ERD?
* Is there a data dictionary? Does it look accurate?
* How descriptive are the headers?
* Who is the custodian of the dataset? How are they maintaining it?
* Do the headers match the data in them?
* How much of the data is missing?
* Can you see numbers like 999, 9999 in values?
* Cleanliness rating
* Distribution of values, counts, averages, min/max
* Verify with a domain expert

This advice is based on my own experience, but is by no means exhaustive. People who work with different datasets than I do will have different views, but I think this applies well to many situations. 

### Storage format

I’d expect most datasets, if presented in a file, to be in a CSV (Comma Separated Variables) or Excel (XLS or XLSX) format. 

If there’s some other weird or proprietary format that I don’t recognise, that would indicate I might have trouble opening the file, reading the contents correctly or finding help on issues and I may have to budget in extra time for converting the file, or finding a way of converting it to a more usable format. 

### File size (kB, MB, GB)

I’d expect smaller datasets to have smaller file sizes, and larger ones to have larger. Most datasets in files I’ve dealt with are in the 1- 50MB range. If I saw an excel file with over 100MB, I’d know there’s a lot going on in that workbook that could make working with it tricky. There’s probably a lot of formulas or analysis happening and I would see if I can separate out just the data I need into a new workbook or CSV. 

Large excel files can be temperamental and have a habit of crashing systems or being very slow to load. An excel file can become corrupted at any time. 

Anything geospatial, especially satellite imagery, can be very large.  If you see file sizes in the GB range, its very likely you’ll need more specialised ways of working with it. It’s good to research how to handle such large files for your needs. For example with satellite imagery, you may need to work via cloud-based virtual machines and some sort of distributed storage and processing (I’m guessing). For CSVs, you may need particular plugins or packages that can access this data without crashing your system. 

### Number of rows and columns

So, how many rows and columns are we looking at? 500 rows? 5 000? 500 000? The order of magnitude will give me a sense of how much data has been collected and what might be possible to analyse in a few scenarios. 

Example: If I was given a dataset of the income streams of all adults in the USA, but it only  had 500 rows of data I’d know it’s likely a dataset of aggregations, and I won’t be able to dive into very granular analysis.

Example: If this dataset were the spending habits of several families over the course of a few years, and there were 500 000 rows, I’d immediately think that this is probably extremely granular detail and there’ll be a lot of angles to look at. 

When it comes to columns (the variables), then a high number of them might tell me a few things. Firstly I expect there to be much fewer columns (variables) vs rows (observations). Let’s say 10, 20 or maybe even 50 columns. When it starts going higher, like 200 columns – that would give me cause for concern in that either the data isn’t structured well, or there’s metadata incorporated into the column names perhaps (harder to extract meaning). Of course there are many exceptions to this but they are more unusual than usual. 

### Data types

What data is contained in each column? Are they mostly numeric (decimals, whole numbers), text (free text, categories), dates and/times (formatting?), true/false (boolean). 

Are the datatypes correct e.g. is a date column actually have the date in it formatted as a date (22-01-2019) or is it actually text (string) format of the date (in which case there could be issues and errors when that was converted)? Does the formatting match what you’d expect e.g. if there’s meant to be a column (variable) with numerical data, is it really a number (e.g. 6000) or a text representation of that (“6k”) – assuming it’s not the spreadsheet software’s own visual formatting that you’re looking at. 

In short, if the data types match the data each column (variable) is meant to contain, you’re off to a good start. If not, tread carefully. 

### Quick scan of first 10 rows

Have a look at the data in the first 10 or 50 or 100 rows and scan over it. Does this data make any sense? Hopefully it will. Are numbers in the same order of magnitude as you’d expect? Are there any easy to spot correlations that make sense? For a dataset on personal wealth you might expect rows (observations) with high salaries to also have high home values.  

### Age of dataset and how often it’s updated

Datasets might be a live stream of information or as in many cases, it’s static and published on a specific date. Static datasets might be updated in a number of ways:

* Repeatedly updated and published as new datasets
* Single dataset gets updated i.e. there aren’t separate files published for each update
* Regular scheduled updates
* Scheduled updates that never end up happening (project is abandoned)
* Updates that happen but only for a specific period with a known or eventual end to the updates. 

And then some datasets are never updated, they were always meant to be a one-time publication.

The age of the dataset will often matter, because you need to gauge how useful the dataset is based on whether it’s outdated for your needs. 

If I want to estimate how many ice cream parlours could be supported by communities in a region, I would need relatively recent census data. Population estimates from 50 years ago would likely not be very useful for me today – for this particular analysis. 

Knowing the age of the dataset and how often it gets updated go hand-in-hand when it comes to being able to provide advice on how reliable the analysis might be, whether you can repeat the analysis in future and what follow up questions can be answered. 

### Purpose of the dataset

When the data was collected, what was the initial purpose? The more aligned that original purpose is with your current needs, the more useful that dataset is likely to be. 

Assume I want to help figure out the prevalence of stray dogs in a city and their effect on public health. A dataset (or datasets) that were collected specifically targeting the same questions, holding information like dog bite injuries in ER, prevalence of rabies, animal control callouts might all be more useful than related datasets of dog licence registration that only tell how many licenced pets there are in different areas. 

### Who uses it now?

This may or may not be tied to the original purpose of the dataset, but understanding who currently uses the dataset (if anyone) will be useful to know from a few angles, but primarily I like to know who I could ask questions of and what future developments might be coming. Perhaps there’s a sales team that uses the data extensively in dashboards and reports. If you know that they’re shifting strategy to measure targets that require new data to be captured in the database, maybe existing data points will be retired.

### How was the data collected?

Is this survey data? Online collection or in person? Trained enumerators or volunteers? Device data from web analytics? Email tracking pixels? Telemetry data from automated systems? Was there data validation upon entry or capture? Has the data gone through any cleaning or preparation between the point of collection and now?

The answers to these questions may be hard to get and you’ll probably pick up bits of information about each dataset as you work with it and gain experience. Over time you’ll get a good overview of how data flows from the point of capture to being ready for analysis, and all the ways it might get lost, changed or how it must be interpreted slightly (or very) differently from what the header, code book or data dictionary specifies. 

Take survey data for example. The same question being asked might be responded to very differently depending on factors like whether it was an in-person or online self-completed questionnaire, whether participants were incentivised to answer or not, whether they were asked in their own language or via translation, from a trained professional enumerator or from an untrained volunteer, in the presence of others or alone, anonymously or not.

### For databases, where is the ERD?

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is key in understanding a database, the tables, fields and datatypes present and how they all relate to one another. 

This goes well together with a Data Dictionary. 

### Is there a data dictionary? Does it look accurate?

A data dictionary will give more detail on the ERD and be easier to search and navigate as it’s in document form, but ideally the data dictionary and ERD go hand in hand. Many databases do not come with a database dictionary but creating one and keeping it updated can be one of your first really valuable additions to any team. 

### How descriptive are the headers?

If the headers have very descriptive names, like “device” , “address”, “owner” you’re going to have a much easier time figuring out what the data is saying  than if you have “XB206\_XT”. Non-obvious headings will take a while to figure out and hopefully there is some pattern to their naming convention, but this is not always the case. 

### Who is the custodian of the dataset? How are they maintaining it?

Whose responsibility is it to maintain the dataset? Who looks after it? What do they do to maintain consistency between updates? How strict are the protocols for ensuring headers retain consistent meanings (hopefully very strict!). These questions help you identify how much trust you can put in the analyses you produce. It’s not unheard of, and not even that uncommon, for datasets to not be properly governed, with definitions and input requirements changing without any control – leading to someone needing a lot of tacit knowledge passed down from one analyst to another to avoid non-obvious issues. 

### Do the headers match the data in them?

It can happen that somewhere in data capture or transformation from to the dataset you’re seeing that something has happened which assigned the wrong column name (variable header) to the wrong column (variable) , so it’s worth a quick check to see if “First Name” actually looks like it contains people names, and not maybe a street address for example. 

I haven’t seen this happen often, but I have seen it.

### How much of the data is missing?

For each variable, check how many of the rows have data for it. In most cases, you want there to be very little (or no) missing data. In other cases, you may expect that a lot of data is missing. This check is really critical because it will have a large impact on what it is you can actually analyse. 

If a dataset of 20 000 train delays only has the train operator completed for 200 of those records, then it’s unlikely you can perform any meaningful analysis comparing train operator performance. 

### Can you see numbers like 999, 9999 in values?

Sometimes when numerical data is being captured, there’s a need to capture that the data is missing for one or more reasons, and then numbers like “999” or “9999” or something similar are used to denote that it’s missing for a specific reason  – as opposed to an NA value which might mean it’s was just never collected, asked for or available. . 

These uses of actual numbers as a form of additional data representation inside a variable that houses regular numeric data can skew your analysis results if you don’t filter them out and it’s not obvious that they’re there – you’ll have to look for them. 

Sometimes you’ll have a code book or a data dictionary that goes along with the dataset which should hopefully highlight that these values exist and what they denote. 

A similar occurrence in geographic coordinates is the use of 0 latitude and 0 longitude, referred to as “[Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island)”.

### Cleanliness rating

How clean the data needs will change from one analysis to another, but you will encounter many datasets that are quite “dirty” and need a lot of cleaning before you can make them work. What do I mean by dirty data and what does cleaning it involve?

There are countless ways in which data can be dirty, but I’ll list some common ones that come to mind. 

* Free text entry where a dropdown options should have been used. You’ll find countless spelling variations of “Mississippi” and you’ll need to transform them all to the correct spelling. 
* Dates and times captured in different formats need alignment.
* Wrong data types captured e.g. numbers are stored as text and need to be converted. 
* Values entered in the wrong order of magnitude e.g data is captured in metric tonnes rather than kilograms. 
* Some values don’t make sense e.g.  a person’s age is 300 years old and that has to be removed. 
* Issues in recoding of special characters in text &quo& and must be removed or  converted back to it’s original representation. 

This is just a taste of some of the issues you’ll face. Personally I find sleuthing and cleaning quite enjoyable but this is often a key reason why just being able to jump into an analysis right away is not possible. You need to build in some allowance for data cleaning.

### Distribution of values, counts, averages, min/max

This will be your first look at the range of data available. For each variable, look at the frequency of values, the distribution of maximum and minimum values and the interquartile ranges. You may even want to have a first look at the correlation of any variables that you think should be obviously correlated. 

This is how I get a feel for the “size and shape” of this data and how much variation there is. In some cases you might expect lots of variation, or might expect very little – or have no expectation at all. That’s ok – you’re just familiarising yourself with the landscape. 

### Verify with a domain expert

Once you’ve got a feel for the dataset, it helps to verify some of your initial findings with a domain expert i.e. someone who is familiar with the content (or “business” side). If you were looking at facilities data, it would be good to check with the Facilities Manager if what you’re finding looks correct. For example, the Facilities Manager might know that there’s a lot of renovation work that’s happened but no one from the admin team have been recording the changes, so most of the data is likely right (building location, footprint size, utility providers etc) but there’ll be some data that’s probably wrong or out of date (value of fixtures and fittings, high risk materials, state of fire suppression systems to name a few).

## Now you know your data!

Having just completed some or all of the checklist, you’ll be one of the few people on earth who understands this dataset as well as you do! 

You’re in a good position to start analysing this data – either by answering questions you’ve been asked or by following the sparks of interest you’ve just had. 

And did you notice something? You’ve actually already begun the analysis! Missing values, distributions, counts, averages – all are useful and valuable info. Even answers like “I don’t know / It’s hard to say” are useful outcomes of the exercise. They’ll inform discussions about the way forward.

wb6ylf,dataanalysis,1659106661.0,"Tl;dr - I started an insights analyst job in May and I can't shake the worry that I have a skills gap between what I did in my last job and what this new job requires. With no one senior above me doing something similar, I'm unsure who to turn to. Should I tell my boss that I'm feeling this way, or how should I proceed?

&#x200B;

Started this job in May. Was a huge opportunity for me in a career sense as it was a big step up, and also a major step up in terms of pay. My previous role was a general marketing insights executive, working under my senior manager. I would do things like take survey outputs and identify themes over what people were saying, or comparing different customer types across various sentiments i.e. very basic data analysis. I've got 1.5 years of professional experience up to taking this job.

The first interview with this company they asked me had I done the technical aspect to the job (working with/ building reporting dashboards) to which I gave a vague yes (working with) but no (have not built) answer. The second round interview was a 20 min chat with the CPO that didn't test anything on my ability to do the role. Applied not really thinking I would get the job but lo and behold I got the offer after the 2 interviews.

Now 3 months into the job I can't shake the feeling that I have a major skills gap in what's required to do this role successfully. I keep trying to make workarounds to the reports via Excel that really need SQL/ Data Studio expertise which I am slowly learning, but do not have full analyst proficiency at present.

This is a new role that the company has never had before as they are a startup that's only starting to mature now. There is no one senior above me so I'm pretty much on my own when it comes to questions.

Have thought about enrolling in online data analysis courses to try and bridge the gap myself which I definitely think can play a part, but I think without someone senior to report into there will always be a gap that I cannot fill. It's starting to make me anxious as I don't want to be a deadweight team member but I also worry that I may have misrepresented myself during the interview process with the technical yes/no answer.

My boss hasn't said anything to make me feel like I could be let go anytime soon but I have asked him for some feedback as we approach the 3 month mark which is scheduled for 2 weeks time. I've voiced before in our 121's that I do feel a level of discomfort with the difference in my skills gap and the ambiguity of a startup (my previous job was the established BigCorp they are disrupting) and my boss has said that this will go away with time, but it has not.

All of this is really starting to take a toll on how competent I feel at work. This is a very technical job which I have never done before. I feel like I could get there with the right training and senior support but I also think that maybe this just isn't for me and I should quit.

Should I tell my boss I'm feeling this way or just try my best to fake it (data analyst courses outside of work hours) till I make it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/wb6ylf/3_months_into_this_insights_analyst_role_and_i/,3 Months Into This Insights Analyst Role and I Feel Like I'm Out of My Depth.,34,16,0.91

I have had quite a few Tableau developer interviews and passed.  Additionally,  I was asked to put together a questions list to test a candidates knowledge. I saw a lot of stuff on the net around basic questions that no one would really ask in an interview. 

In my experience these interview are given by a tech person  or  manager who has little experience with the Tableau. So their purpose is to see if you can solve the problems they are facing, hear your experience with the product and see a portfolio.  A lot the questions that are asked are:

Do you have experience using Tableau with X to do X? 

For Example: 

 Do you have any experience connecting Tableau to databases, live connections or APIs?  

 Have you ever had to migrate Tableau dashboards or reports from one environment to another?  

These questions  that allow you to expound on your knowledge and is probably a issue that they are facing.  I have never been asked simplistic questions around the product.

z4wp8d,dataanalysis,1669433054.0,"Hi all,

I'm currently a senior at an undergrad majoring in Economics and am expected to graduate in 3 months. I started the google data analytics course and I'm still at the middle of course 2 and there really is no other excuse other than my lack of time management and trying to bump my overall GPA to a 3.0 as I am right under that threshold right now.

Now, I'm in a very lost spot and wanted to seek some advice.

One big reason that I think I am not progressing in my Google Data Analytics course is that I don't find the early lectures to be all too entertaining as it is mainly going over what a data analyst tackles and the teaching you the soft skills and what specific questions you will be asking once you do become an analyst. It's not that I'm not interested and want to switch to a different field at all. I came into this course expecting to dive fully into the hard skills and start learning them. 

I just know that I need those skills so badly and was wondering if I should *skip to course 4* and revisit the first three courses. But, I guess I just need to power through and get to course 4 ASAP as I heard that is where the fun begins.

I am not expecting this to be a free-pass to land a job in the data analyst/business analyst field, but I thought the capstone project at the end would be a huge plus to add to my resume to up my value, but I remember seeing posts here that that alone is not enough.

So, this brings me to my actual question. **What else should I be doing? Should I only focus on the google course and aim to finish ASAP and do school simultaneously and once that is done, should I start learning a Python course since the Google DA doesn't teach (maybe preferably with a certificate) and another SQL course to strengthen my learnings?**

I have a background in Excel and I obtained the Microsoft Office Specialist Excel Expert certificate to prove that on my resume but that was also 2 years ago and to be quite frank I am a bit rusty right now. This also led me to slacking on applying to internship positions as I know I am not actually skilled for the jobs. This is bad and I need to fix it.

Along with GPA and one leadership position I am holding in an extracurricular org in school, I'm still going to finish the Google DA course as soon as possible, **but I want to know what else I need to be doing right now that I can achieve in the next 2-3 months so I can transition smoothly into a full time position as an analyst role? (I do not have any internship experience)**

* I'm primarily using Python. Is it conventional to share your project in the form of a Jupyter notebook so you can explain your thinking process here and there throughout the script, or do people post a package with modules? I'm somewhat less familiar with the latter and frankly have not been doing a ton of OOP (I do it when something seems obviously reusable, but other than that, no. However, I could figure this out and restructure my code if that's the necessary convention for portfolio presentation.)
* Should my portfolio showcase code (like I was assuming in the first bullet) or is it actually supposed to be showcasing 'deliverables' like a report with business recommendations, presentation slides, a Tableau dashboard, etc? I am a career changer and would like to lean into my communication/presentation skills and ability to synthesize info as a strength, but I am not sure whether the portfolio is a place for that or if I should just be presenting code there.
* I was presuming I'd be posting on github and possibly also sharing my tableau public link. Is this normal/is there a better option?
* Regarding SQL: I am using mysql-connector in python so there are bits of SQL in some of my portfolio projects, but is there a different/better way to showcase SQL skills? I've been using SQL queries while doing EDA in pandas, so the queries have been relatively straightforward (not showing use of temp tables, CTEs, etc.) What does a SQL portfolio project look like?
* It would be really helpful for me to see data analyst portfolios that are strong so I can understand the conventions of how to present portfolios. Do you know or any examples or are you willing to share your own?

I was in the middle of a course in Coursera, one that would provide me with a certificate upon completion.  I was finishing one of the assignments and the minute I clicked ""submit"" the page was redirected to an error page, I tried to go back to the assignment and it said I was no longer enrolled in the course.

I then contacted support who told me I had been unsubscribed, even tough I never asked to be, and that I should just subscribe again and would not lose my progress. 

However, when I try to subscribe again the prices are now higher. Support asked me to understand that they adjust the price as they see how much value the course provides.

How can I understand that? It seems extremely unethical and dodgy that they would do something like this. Anyway, is there anyway I can protect myself against this? Any authority that I can report it to? Also, which other platform would you guys recommend to learn data analytics in python and get a certificate?

* Graduated from University in 2021 with a degree in economics
* Completed Google Data Analytics Certification + UC Davis SQL Certification
* Sadly, only work experience comes from the service job I'm currently working
* No internship experience

I understand that the certifications I mentioned aren't enough to land myself an entry-level job.  I've worked on a few projects that I've put on my portfolio and mentioned on my resume.  I've been applying to jobs for the past few months, and haven't had much success.  I've looked at some posts that listed some things you should do to prepare for interviews (sites like stratascratch) and believe that I would be ready to pass an interview.  Sadly, getting to that stage is where I'm coming up short.  

I've been applying to as many jobs as I can without changing my resume.  Would tailoring my resume to every job I apply to but applying to less jobs be a better approach?  Should I keep grinding projects?  Is there anything I can do to make myself a more competitive candidate?  Or do I just need to keep going at it and hope something sticks?

The number of ways something can be done incorrectly and not noticed is the most profound impression I've had.

1. **Assume all of your data operations and assumptions\* are wrong**.
2. **Re-examine your operations and assumptions with systematic scrutiny\*\*.**
3. **Then, move on with confidence after fixing errors.**

\* Assumptions of business processes, behavior of data columns, cleanliness of data, etc.

\*\* See my comment for examples of systematic scrutiny.

The trouble with analysis is that it's not very self-checking. If you had an error in any piece of query, code, formula or data assumption then everything built on that is wrong. And if you only run the analysis once, you will not know it. Unless your final output can be compared to an objective, known value, then each step you take should be double checked!

Graduated with a BS in Bio in May 2020, working as a MT/MLS with a lot of Excel-heavy tools that put me through a crash course of functions, formulas, pivot tables, and putting together reports. Went through the Google Data Analytics Certificate, plus a small amount of independent SQL/Python courses on DataCamp. Offer is at a large BioTech company with a local branch for 70k, 6% match and optional hybrid/fully remote!

A lot of things went into my choice to pursue data analytics. Wanting to spend more time doing my hobbies/looking after my health, spending times with my partner and friends, and something I'm immediately excited for: getting rid of the 30-minute commute combined with a 15-minute walk to and from the parking lot (perks of working at a *very* large hospital). But I also learned I had a knack for playing with numbers! This started with pulling, cleaning, and presenting a lot of lab data; time flew, and I steadily improved how I went about it with advanced Excel shenanigans. I heavily leaned on this during my job search.

Very excited for this opportunity; it is actually a decrease in pay when overtime/on call pay is taken into account, but the 401k match (from 0%), lack of commute, and no longer feeling stagnant in my career more than make up for it. I was very transparent about my minimal experience in programming and they made it clear that training would be offered for Python/R/SQL if I wanted to advance beyond Excel!

Remember as kids, how excited some of us used to get about listening to stories. 

Well, for me, I still am attracted to storytelling. From eagerly waiting for grandma’s stories to creating and telling stories myself, I believe an effective storyteller is someone who can make the readers visualize the plot with just his words.

And similar is the case with **Data storytelling**. 

Follow these 8 commandments of storytelling to learn how to tell stories as a data scientist

8 Commandments of Storytelling with Data

1. **BEGIN WITH A QUESTION**

Set up your story. What is your audience going to learn?

2. **END WITH AN INSIGHT**

If we can’t learn something useful from the data, the story isn’t worth telling.

3. **TELL A COMPELLING STORY**

People remember stories, not data. Take them on your journey.

4. **EXPLAIN WITH VISUALS, NARRATE WITH WORDS**

People understand metrics, trends and patterns better with visuals. Use words to add your voice to the data

5. **BE HONEST AND CREDIBLE**

Our clients value honesty, so don’t sugarcoat the negatives.

6. **BE CLEAR AND CONCISE**

Don’t add anything that is not a part of your story, save it for some other time

7**. KNOW AND CATER TO YOUR AUDIENCE**

Understand their goals and frame your story according to that.

8. **PROVIDE CONTEXT**

Compare your metrics over time, numbers are meaningless without context.

obi8be,dataanalysis,1625132157.0,"Video gaming is fast becoming the most popular recreational past-time globally. With the gaming market reportedly worth $138 billion (USD) in 2018, it has been predicted to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 10%, reaching $180 billion (USD) by 2021.

Therefore, more users around the world want popular games to be translated and adapted to their regions. Reciprocally, there’s a rapid increase in localization, a subsector of the gaming industry. Its goal is to create a smoother playing experience for the end user by taking into account their specific cultural context, while being faithful to the source material.

The problem many game localization companies face, however, is the challenging task of analyzing user reviews for useful insights and to inform the localization process. This costs the company time and money, and delays users from fully enjoying their chosen game.

This article will demonstrate how such analysis can be done efficiently, by looking at a project carried out for Allcorrect as a part of the Data Analyst [Practicum by Yandex bootcamp](https://practicum.yandex.com/?utm_source=pr&utm_medium=content&utm_content=video_game_localization&utm_campaign=pr_content_main_reddit) this year. Specifically, examples of using some popular Python packages for dealing with text data in multiple languages are presented, such as deep\_translator, lang\_detect, and NLTK.

## The data

The data used for the report in this article is provided by Allcorrect. It includes game ID, user score and review text in its original language. The games are on both mobile and PC platforms, which have different user scoring systems. The game IDs have been anonymized.

To prepare for the analysis, reviews that mention localization need to be identified. In this project, there are a total of 140 keywords in 27 languages used to filter the data. One of the challenges in this process is the differences among languages. Users might mention the word 'localization' in their reviews, but use more than one expression in their original language. Therefore, having only one translation for 'localization' in the keywords will miss the reviews containing other expressions.

Using the Chinese language for example, the keywords *Chinese*, *localization* and *English* can be translated as 中文，本土化，英语 respectively. However, in the user reviews, we also find the use of 华语，汉化，英文 to refer to the same concepts. These need to be included in the keywords as not to miss important localization reviews. The same would apply to other languages as well.

Using the keywords to filter the data, slightly over 1% of it was about localization (a total of 152,447 records). In what follows, we will demonstrate how to carry out language detection, translation, and emoji conversion on text data. Then, we'll discuss how to use a logistic regression model to reveal the dynamics of positive and negative reviews. Finally, we'll examine the most common reasons for negative reviews. (Where there are code examples, the variable *reviews* is used to refer to the localization review dataset.)

## Useful packages, tools and functions

Before diving into the details of the analysis, let's briefly introduce the most useful Python packages that were used in the analysis of large texts in multiple languages. This section will list the packages used, as well as some useful functions that readers could modify and use.

**1) langdetect** is a package used for language detection. To apply functions to large dataset, **swifter** is a useful package that will speed up the pandas processing speed. (For more information, click [here ](https://towardsdatascience.com/speed-up-your-pandas-processing-with-swifter-6aa314600a13)) Below you'll find a demonstration of how the two work together.)

    # install the packages 
    !pip install langdetect
    !pip install swifter
     
    # import the packages
    from langdetect import detect
    from langdetect import DetectorFactory
    import swifter
     
    # to avoid unstable results everytime the language detection function is run
    DetectorFactory.seed = 0
     
    # define a function that can be applied to the text column 
    def detect_language(x):
        try:
            language = detect(x)
        except:
            language = 'Other'
        return language
     
    # an example of applying the function using swifter on a dataframe named ""reviews""
    reviews['language'] = reviews['text'].swifter.apply(detect_language)

**2) GoogleTranslator**, from the Python **deep\_translator** package, is a useful tool to translate text reviews. Given that GoogleTranslator does not work when the text exceeds a certain length, when defining the function to apply to dataframe, a try-except would come in handy. (More info on the Python's deep\_translator document can be found, [here ](https://pypi.org/project/deep-translator/).) Below we demonstrate how to use this package to define a function to translate text data.

    # install and import the package
    !pip install -U deep_translator
    from deep_translator import GoogleTranslator
     
    # define the function to translate the text column
    def translate(x):
      try:
         translation = GoogleTranslator(source='auto', target='en').translate(x)
         return translation
      except:
        return ""not translated""

3) **Emojis** are used often in review text data. As these reflect users' feelings, and at times, we may want to keep them. One way to retain such data for text analysis is to convert them into text. This is where the Python package [emoji](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/) comes in handy. The code below demonstrates the process of using this package to define a function to convert the emojis to text data.

    # install and import the package
    !pip install emoji
    import emoji
    from emoji import UNICODE_EMOJI
     
    # define a series of functions 
     
    # first a function that returns True or False the text is an emoji
    def is_emoji(s):
        return s in UNICODE_EMOJI
     
    # define a function that will add space around each emoji
    def add_space(text):
        return ''.join(' ' + char if is_emoji(char) else char for char in text).strip()
     
    # convert emoji to text
    def convert_emojis(text):
        try: 
           return emoji.demojize(text)
        except:
          return text 
     
    # an example of applying the above functions 
    reviews['text'] = reviews['text'].apply(add_space)
    reviews['text'] = reviews['text'].apply(convert_emojis)

The tools described above are just some of the ones that proved useful when preparing the dataset for further analysis. With those in place, let's move on to discuss the analysis.

## Top 10 requested languages and games

Applying the language detection function to the review text column allows us to find out the most popular languages in which the localization reviews are written.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5rd3wn4gkk871.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=998c7ac8635d1031600eb5afcd60a0a93f2df83f

The graph above shows the top 10 languages with the most localization reviews: **simplified Chinese**, **Korean**, **Russian**, **Turkish**, **English**, **Spanish**, **Italian**, **French**, **Thai**, and **Japanese**. Examination of the text data further reveals the prevalence of user requests of local versions or improvement of existing local versions of games in these languages. Such information provides useful insights as to which languages the game localization companies should focus on in their strategic development plans.

We also generated the top 10 games (in terms of the number of their localization reviews) below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ohgmovmkk871.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=16fd151281010cd3f719d277c4e8f895a471d8f1

The graph above shows the games the company should focus on when developing localization plans.

Further analysis of reviews for a particular game should reveal the user's preferences, such as whether the game should be localized in a particular language or that existing localization versions should be improved.

## User sentiments in localization reviews

To distinguish the user sentiment (positive or negative feelings) in the reviews, reviews were assigned as negative (score 1 or 2 for mobile games and 0 for pc), neutral (score 3), and positive (4 or 5 for mobile games and 1 for pc). A breakdown of review sentiments is shown below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0gt56o5qkk871.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=620996cc5ec3e71d3617ceccc6c4d51adb2677bf

Among all the localization reviews, over 65% were positive, approximately 23% were negative, and 11% remained neutral. It's good news that the majority of the reviews mentioning localization are positive. Our focus here is to understand the dynamics of positive and negative reviews, particularly reasons for negative reviews. To that end, the neutral reviews have been removed and 10% of the total data has been sliced and translated, which is used to build a logistic regression model. The resulting dataframe has the following structure:

    ['game_id' 'text' 'score' 'language' 'positive' 'english']

## Examining positive and negative reviews

Having translated the reviews into English and then converted emojis into text, the positive and negative review texts were used to generate wordclouds to highlight any patterns.(Python has a wordcloud library and [here ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generating-word-cloud-python/)is a demonstration of how to use it.) First, a wordcloud for positive reviews.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ge1eupukk871.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b4cd8d19eb61f766cf285c3e5551a67982b721

Words such as 'great', 'good', 'fun', 'better' stood out, but words like 'difficult' and 'problem' were also present. Expressions like 'language support', 'turkish language', and 'chinese' indicate the need for specific languages.

Next, let's see the negative reviews wordcloud.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2oc3p6pwkk871.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd12e1655ef2c3b99893b7fc3a3b2d0e572842f1

Again we see words like 'good' stand out. Words such as 'problem', 'bad', 'need', and ""can't"" are likely to indicate issues faced by users.

Despite the above observation, there are no distinct differences in patterns between positive and negative reviews using wordclouds alone. Hence why a logistic model was built to reveal underlying dynamics.

## A logistic regression model to detect positive or negative review patterns

Using a logistic regression model makes interpretation easy and can be learned quickly. It also performs well for the sparse matrix of vectorized words.

The goal of fitting a logistic model here is not to predict the sentiment of reviews, however. It is believed that the score given by the user reflects their satisfaction level more accurately, whereas the role of their text reviews is to provide additional information or explanation. Therefore, the main goal is to reveal the underlying text patterns.

Before using the review text column and the binary positive column to build a simple logistic regression model, the text review column needs to be processed. The function used to retrieve the text data is shown below.

The key Python packages needed for this function are provided by the NLTK library: **stopwords**, **word\_tokenize**, and **WordNetLemmatizer:**

    # define a function to further process the reviews text in english
    def process(text):
      #tokenize the text
      tokens = word_tokenize(text)
      # convert to lower case
      tokens = [w.lower() for w in tokens]
      # remove punctuation from each word
      table = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
      stripped = [w.translate(table) for w in tokens]
      # remove remaining tokens that are not alphabetic
      words = [word for word in stripped if word.isalpha()]
      # filter out stop words
      stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
      words = [w for w in words if not w in stop_words]
      #apply lemmatization 
      words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]
      text = "" "".join(words)
      return text
     
    # then we get a function that can be applied to the text column.

After processing the text column, the first five rows of the data used for the logistic regression model look like this:

       english                                          positive
    0    game top thumbsup thumbsup clappinghands clapp...    1
    1    indonesian facewithrollingeyes    0
    2    love find hidden object game like word must co...    1
    3    nt italian    1
    4    problem change language mother since english u...    1

Let's now move onto the steps of fitting a logistic model to the data.

The data frame is split into train and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training, and 20% will be used for testing. Alternatively, the train\_test\_split method can be used to split the data, but here let's try another way:

    # random split train and test data to 80% and 20%
    index = df.index
    df['random_number'] = np.random.randn(len(index))
    train = df[df['random_number'] <= 0.8]
    test = df[df['random_number'] > 0.8]

To perform logistic regression analysis on text data, the text first needs to be tokenized and vectorized using a tool from the Scikit-learn library, **CounterVectorizer**.

    # count vectorizer:
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(token_pattern=r'\b\w+\b')
    train_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(train['english'])
    test_matrix = vectorizer.transform(test['english'])
    
    # create an instance of the class LogisticRegression 
    lr = LogisticRegression()
    # split target and independant variables 
    X_train = train_matrix
    X_test = test_matrix
    y_train = train['positive']
    y_test = test['positive']

Two hyperparameters are fine tuned in the model: penalty and C values. GridSearchCV is used to find the optimal values for them.

    # Let's find out with what hyperparameter give the best model results.
    penalty = ['l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet', 'none']
    c_values = [100, 10, 1.0, 0.1, 0.01]
    grid = dict(penalty=penalty,C=c_values)
    cv = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, n_repeats=3, random_state=1)
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=lr, param_grid=grid, n_jobs=-1, cv=cv, scoring='accuracy',error_score=0)
    grid_result = grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

&#x200B;

    # print the best hyperparameter values
    print(""Best: %f using %s"" % (grid_result.best_score_, grid_result.best_params_))
     
    Best: 0.726493 using {'C': 0.1, 'penalty': 'l2'}

It looks like at the default level C=0.1, penalty at 'l2', the best results are achieved. Those will be used as hyperparameters.

    # fit the model on data
    lr = LogisticRegression(C=0.1, penalty='l2', random_state=0)
    final_model = lr.fit(X_train,y_train)
     
    # make predictions
    predictions = final_model.predict(X_test)

The result is a successfully built and trained simple logistic regression model. Checking the accuracy score for both training and test data shows that the model has an overall 78% prediction accuracy on the training data, and 73% accuracy on the testing data. Or model is slightly overfitted.

## Discriminating words for positive and negative reviews

Using the logistic regression model, words or patterns that feature in the positive or negative reviews can be revealed. Let's look at the 10 most discriminating words for both types of reviews. This is done by looking at the largest and smallest coefficients, respectively.

    print(""Top 10 discriminating words for positive reviews:"")
     
    feature_to_coef = {
        word: coef for word, coef in zip(
            vectorizer.get_feature_names(), final_model.coef_[0]
        )
    }
    for best_positive in sorted(
        feature_to_coef.items(), 
        key=lambda x: x[1], 
        reverse=True)[:10]:
        print(best_positive)
     
    print (""\nTop 10 discriminating words for negative reviews:"")    
     
    best_negative_list = []
    for best_negative in sorted(
        feature_to_coef.items(), 
        key=lambda x: x[1])[:10]:
        best_negative_list.append(best_negative)
        print (best_negative)

&#x200B;

    Top 10 discriminating words for positive reviews:
    ('excellent', 1.2318797837182207)
    ('perfect', 1.0922819266631894)
    ('cool', 1.0645717900879892)
    ('nice', 1.004451706604957)
    ('great', 0.9375519484038363)
    ('fun', 0.9196472963620572)
    ('hope', 0.890851739223927)
    ('best', 0.7966138811023504)
    ('super', 0.775542710090151)
    ('wonderful', 0.7670213758020292)
     
    Top 10 discriminating words for negative reviews:
    ('rubbish', -0.8713436190047102)
    ('uninstall', -0.8652553696990095)
    ('terrible', -0.8452426468565963)
    ('uninstalled', -0.8315787570336696)
    ('refund', -0.7895618598247778)
    ('shit', -0.7562280034676745)
    ('junk', -0.7239565503012998)
    ('poor', -0.7209821924340266)
    ('garbage', -0.6243783857945131)
    ('delete', -0.6128080797008089)

The 10 most discriminating negative words have been saved for when we examine the negative reviews.

## Examine the negative reviews

The most important piece of information that the company wants to know is the reasons behind the negative reviews (involving localization). Therefore, all the negative localization review text data has been translated into English for closer examination. The key method used for this purpose is word concordances, a combination of keywords and discriminating negative words from the logistic regression model.

The negative review text column has been processed in the same way as the logistic model. A column has also been added to show the number of words in the reviews.

Using this data, it is possible to look at the distribution of review length, the top languages in which those negative reviews were written, as well as which games they refer to, before moving on to the negative review characteristics.

## Distribution of length of reviews

There are a total of 31,631 negative reviews about localization in the dataset. Below are two histograms showing the distribution of length in the number of words. The first shows the total number, and the second is with the outliers removed.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6w6139wslk871.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f9b62b579db3c91e8cf02a246ad7dc1fa5d1cd

From the above histogram, we can determine that most negative reviews are under 50 words in length. We will use this information to filter the reviews when examining their patterns using the method of word concordances.

## Top languages and games for negative reviews

Will the top 10 languages for negative reviews differ from those for all reviews? Let's take a look.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wsnsmucvlk871.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8affd238b760cddbbf3b32b667d08d855dcebb4

As the graph above demonstrates, the top 10 languages dominating the negative reviews are **Simplified Chinese, Russian, Korean, Turkish, English, Italian, Spanish, French, Japanese,** and **German**. The difference between this and the previous ranking for all reviews is the German language.

Next, let's see what 10 games have the most negative reviews about localization.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rnm8ttcxlk871.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e1c9da75cd1d9333c1f726c4e85b5a67f890bcb

The above shows the 10 games that have the most negative reviews that mention localization.

Although not all these reviews are negative exactly because of their localization quality - the filtering of localization reviews wasn't perfect - this data is still useful for localization companies to conduct further investigations into those games.

## Examining the negative reviews using word concordances

To examine the text reviews using word concordances, we need to first create a corpus for the review text, instantiate an NLTK text object using the corpus, and then call the concordance method. Below shows a code example carrying this procedure.

    # First, define a function to get corpus out of a text column
    def corpus(column):
      words_list = []
      for text in column:
        try:
          words = word_tokenize(text)
          words_list += words
        except:
          words = word_tokenize(str(text))
          words_list += words
      return words_list

&#x200B;

    # build the corpus and create an NLTK text object
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    corpus = corpus(df['english'].str.lower())
    text = nltk.Text(corpus)
     
    # find the first 20 lines of matches that have 'language'
    text.concordance(""language"", lines=20)

Using this method, concordances for the following words have been generated:

* language
* translation
* localization/localization
* problem
* difficult
* rubbish
* terrible
* \[censored\]
* grammar

These are a mixture of the localization key words, what we observed from the wordclouds, as well as the discriminating negative words generated from the logistic regression model. The list can certainly expand depending on the information being sought.

For each concordance, we have generated 20 matching lines for further examination. Below is an example of such concordances matching the word 'language'.

    Displaying 20 of 11812 matches:

Examination of the concordances for all the selected keywords shows that, although in most reviews related to localization there is the mention of the lack of the users' native language in the games, an additional urgency can be detected.

Чтобы изменить содержимое ячейки, дважды нажмите на нее (или выберите ""Ввод"")

These can be shown in, for example:

* ""When is Polish language???????"" with many questions marks to emphasize
* the '!"" after ""there is no Russian language!""
* please add/put language of ...
* ""Turkish support should be added immediately""
* ""don't your hurry up and fix it""

The analysis also reveals the difficulty users experience when playing games without local language support, for example:

* ""without Vietamaese it is too difficult to play""
* ""difficult to understand because it is not in...""
* ""difficult to understand instructions""
* ""the method of Japanese mod is difficult""
* ""Thai language... difficult ... to be able to play""

Users also noted the issue with localization quality, for example:

* ""translation is rubbish""
* 'terrible translation""
* ""The Chinese localization is rubbish, even worse than google translation""
* 'weird grammar""
* ""can not play because of missing grammar""

and potential cultural conflict, for example

* ""discriminate against Chinese""

Furthermore, given the concern that not all reviews that mention localization are negative because of a specific localization problem, it is important to find out what negative comments are being made about localization. Therefore, the following function might be useful:

    # define a simple function to calculate how many rows in the review column contains particular word or expression
    def cal_keyword(keyword, column):
      count = 0
      for value in column: 
        if value.find(keyword) != -1:
          count +=1
      return count 

The function can of course be applied to find the frequency of any expressions, such as 'language sucks', 'bad grammar', or 'poor translation', to make the search more specific. The function and its modifications will allow the analyst to quickly locate reviews of particular patterns and perform further analysis on them.

For example, applying the function using 'bad translation' reveals there are 48 matching records. A possible next step would be to find out which these are, what games, and what languages.

    # First let's check out those that contain language 
    cal_keyword('bad translation', df['english'])
     
    48

## Conclusion

The analysis discussed in this article reveals the most popular languages among the reviews, as well as which games received the most reviews mentioning localization. These would provide useful information for the localization company on what to focus in their strategic planning.

An investigation of the positive and negative reviews translated in English shows that they exhibit similar structures in language use, both noting the lack of games in a specific language and the difficulty that causes gamers to experience.

A notable difference in the positive reviews is that the lack of a local language version may not have impacted the enjoyment of the game. For negative reviews, having no local language version or a bad translation add to the barriers of game play, even arousing a feeling of discrimination in some cases, and so a hint of detected urgency and frustration.

To sum up, the top reasons for negative sentiments are :

* lack of specific language
* bad/poor/terrible translation
* difficult in understanding or playing in English
* repeated requests to add language not addressed
* discrimination/stereotypes
* bad/awkward localization
* wrong, bad, or weird grammar and punctuation use

The tools and functions described in this article allow the company to quickly distinguish what languages and games they should pay particular attention to in their localization plans. An easy to apply method has also been provided, which allows the company to examine the reasons for negative reviews. Using the procedure demonstrated, it is also possible for the localization company to further examine which languages and games the problems persist in, such as poor translation or even stereotypes, and take action accordingly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/obi8be/video_game_localization_how_to_find_out_user/,Video Game Localization: How to Find Out User Difficulty and Expectations,31,2,1.0

At the beginning of this year I knew I was going to leave the teaching profession. I dived into data analytics work and started training myself in SQL, Python, and visualization tools like PowerBi. 
I applied to over 100 jobs and nothing. I finally made a portfolio/changed my resume and then interviews are pouring in. 

I just got offered a job. Seems like a nice place but health insurance is not great. The offer was 75k. I have to relocate for this position which means selling my home and buying another. My monthly expenses would increase but overall I will get a small bump in my monthly budget compared to teaching. This place told me I have 24 hours to accept the job. 
Here’s the issue. I have 5 other places interviewing me. One is local 3 are remote. I don’t want to be ungrateful for the offer but it’s hard to wonder what the others will say. My recruiter tells me I have a good chance at one of  the places. 
What makes this decision hard is wanting to leave education with the current dynamic. My wife is pregnant so health insurance is important. I thought about counter offering the current offer for a slightly higher salary to overcome health cost or ask them to contribute to HSA. 

Should I accept the first offer and be excited I got offered a decent wage for being so green? It’s hard to know what to choose when I’m new to this tech field.


UPDATE: 
First I like to thank everyone and your support. It’s been a busy week. I accepted the job. To help buy some time I sent a counter offer and decided to wait and see what would happen. In addition they are giving me every vacation time for when the baby is born. Sadly it was better than my benefits as a teacher. 
So I am moving, but they are allowing me to work remotely for up to 90 days while I work on my transition. They even upped my hire date so I can receive benefits soon.

117jae6,dataanalysis,1676924200.0,"I've been taking a deep dive into strengthening my Tableau skills lately to combine with and practice my SQL skills, but it seems like some of the more complex things in Tableau require you to do calculations in that rather than in SQL. For example, I want to create a dashboard of KPIs using the Tableau Superstore dataset (similar to [this](https://workout-wednesday.com/2022w31tab/) dashboard), but I want to use SQL to make my calculations before moving over to Tableau. So let's say I want to find the sum of sales, profit, and orders per month per year. I also went ahead and calculated the percent change in sales, profit, and orders (just in case I wanted to use them for something). That query is below:

    -- separate month and year to group orders by month
    With date as (
    Select DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%m') as month, DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y') as year,
    		sales, profit, order_id
    From orders
    ),
    
    -- sum sales and profit
    sums as (
    Select month, year, ROUND(SUM(sales), 2) as sales, ROUND(SUM(profit), 2) as profit, 
    		COUNT(distinct order_id) as sum_orders
    From date
    Group by month, year
    Order by month ASC, year ASC
    )
    
    -- month over month sales, profit, and orders
    Select month, year, sales, 
    		ROUND((sales - LAG(sales) OVER(order by year, month)) / 
    			lag(sales) OVER(order by year, month) * 100, 2) as percent_change_in_sales,
    		profit,
    		ROUND((profit - LAG(profit) OVER(order by year, month)) / 
    			lag(profit) OVER(order by year, month) * 100, 2) as percent_change_in_profit,
    		sum_orders,
            ROUND((sum_orders - LAG(sum_orders) OVER(order by year, month)) / 
    			lag(sum_orders) OVER(order by year, month) * 100, 2) as percent_change_in_orders
    From sums
    Group by month, year
    Order by year, month

But now if I wanted to display a breakdown of the sub-categories sold as shown in the example dashboard, I wouldn't be able to do any of this because including the sub-categories in my query would break everything up by sub_category. Is that just the necessary evil of having to work with Tableau and to be able to get everything out of Tableau? Should I be more ""general"" with my query and allow Tableau to calculate sums and other things?

One thing that I would like to say (again as someone who is about to embark on the journey towards becoming a data analyst) is to JUST GO FOR IT.

The only thing that will FOR SURE stop you from working in data is sitting back and not pursuing it. 

No two people have the same circumstances or opportunities. 

Some people send out 50 resumes, some people (at least on here) send out 100’s of resumes. But you know who doesn’t get to send out even one? The person that didn’t try to get their foot in the door.


I hope this encourages someone to stop waiting for a magic ball to tell them whether or not they’d be able to get the dream career they are searching for - or waiting and looking for someone else who has done the exact same thing and is super duper successful because the reality is you’ll for sure get some sort of opportunity if you can prove yourself.

mzaztv,dataanalysis,1619479481.0," Originally, this project was going to test correlation between bitcoin's price and it's hashrate. As I dug into it, it seemed more and more like a useless enterprise and I kind of lost interest. However, in gathering the data, I read about a large drop-off (45%) in hashrate earlier this month (4/15/21). Looking into it further, most sources attributed this drop to blackouts in Xinjiang, China where a lot of mining operations are conducted (see Bitcoin mining map of China below). It was a strong indication of China's dominance in the Bitcoin mining, and further Googling found that sources attribute 60% of the global hashrate to China. This led me down another rabbit hole - geographic distribution (or rather concentration) of bitcoin mining in China, and got me wondering about the potential effects this might have on the total hashrate. 

A few articles I read touched on yearly miner migrations within China - moving seasonally to areas where the rates of electricity are under-utilized and over-supplied. One of the biggest, if not the biggest driver of these migrations is hydro-electricity during the rainy season (Jun-Sep), mainly in the Sichuan and Northern Yunnan provinces. Dams like Xiluodu (3rd largest power station in the world) produce tons of cheap electricity for the region. What seems to happen is that many mining farms relocate to these areas during the rainy season, and transition back to areas with thermal power facilities (coal) like Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in the dry season. Rates for electricity during the wet season can be twice as cheap as those in thermal power.

I decided to test some of these numbers for myself - just to see if there was a recognizable pattern. For all you traders out there, I would have loved to have tied this to price action but the geeky side of me got a little carried away and this is mostly an academic endeavor. But hey, if you see some profitable insight here share the love and let a brother know! I plot hashrate vs. price at the end of this article if you are interested.

Here is a de-trended (more on that in a bit) box-and-whisker plot of average monthly hashrate for the last 3 years:

[Hashrate Trends 2018-2020](https://preview.redd.it/molpnqvxplv61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=a454c441cb4c0ae0c9409cdbda582b57bbad6038)

You can see a yearly increase in hashrate starting around May/June and dropping off again around October, coinciding with average rainfall in Sichuan:

[Average Rainfall in Sichuan \(Chengdu\)](https://preview.redd.it/cr5adj20qlv61.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4a7e7ab6131dae894277fb2e94288997443757a)

In order to get this data and visualize any cyclical patterns, I had to correct for a large uptrend - a meteoric rise in hashrate over the last 5-6 years due to the recent popularity of crypto, the scaling of commercial mining operations, and better hardware i.e. higher hashrate, better energy efficiency (see hashrate graph below). If this correction wasn't made, all we'd see is a large increase in hashrate - and you wouldn't need this article to tell you that.

I started by running a series decomposition using Python's statsmodel library. It's used as a general indicator for trends/seasonality by calculating a trend line and seasonal patterns, but should be used as a weak indicator and taken with a grain of salt. I used to it make sure I was headed in the right general direction and to reference later. Since I was looking for a seasonal trend I aggregated average hashrate per month to see what, if any, seasonal patterns were present. Plotting out this decomposition gives you the following:

[Each ghetto snipping tool markup indicates a year](https://preview.redd.it/umwh31j2qlv61.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f0f74266f0e9d52de86ec5218bb845a6f3ea500)

With this weak confirmation of seasonality present, I took it further by deconstructing my own means of trend correction with the intent to plot each year's monthly distribution of daily hashrate and see if the different years resembled each other. I used the NumPy .polyfit() module to do a polynomial regression on average daily hashrates from 2015-2021 (to represent the ""trend""), and then used the difference between the actual hashrate (observed) and the trendline (prediction) to create another dataset. What you see in the boxplots above are the distributions of these differences by month and year. 

**In plain English, I was asking ""how much over or under was the actual observed hashrate compared to the hashrate predicted by the general uptrend?""**. The boxplots show that in the rainy months, the actual hashrate generally sits above the trend.

Here is the actual hashrates, in green, plotted against the trendline, in blue:

[Observed vs. Predicted Average Daily Hashrate](https://preview.redd.it/w4m1kgj5qlv61.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8b4166de9d9042240536b902785fa3d673e338)

Teasing out seasonality any earlier than 2017 was difficult to do as the average hashrates are comparatively so much smaller early years than in later years, that the regression line being used to represent the ""trend"" is a lot less representative in those earlier years. You can see in the plot above, that prior to 2017/2018 the trend line doesn't fit the data as well in a relative sense ('relative' being the key word here).

If I scrunch the timeline and the regression down to 3 years and run the regression then, it follows the trend a bit better but still doesn't give us anything too significant in terms of seasonality. You can see them below. A little better, but I think still skewed by external macro trends. Keep in mind that bitcoin mining is still in relative infancy - the ASIC was introduced 2013 and 2014-2016 marked the rise of China's dominance in mining with pools like Bitmain and Antpool. 

I imagine it takes a bit of time to learn and refine your operations so that large consolidated efforts like mining farm migration might not have been as prevalent in those earlier years. The data may also have been skewed by early regulatory disruptions like China shutting down exchanges in 2017.

**In conclusion (yay!)**, we can see that there is a disproportionate concentration of mining operations in China mainly due to an abundance of low-cost energy (sometimes subsidized), and in my humble opinion - a larger supply of low-cost, tech-savvy labor willing to live in the middle of butt-fuck nowhere to maintain mining farms (Read: Lower Quality-of-Life). I know the crypto-world loathes the word ""centralization"" - generally following libertarian principles of self-sovereignty and free-market yadda-yadda-beep-boop. So on the surface this concentration seems like a bad or maybe even a dangerous thing, but the reality is that these miners account for a large portion of bitcoin's network security - and if they fucked around and the price of bitcoin tanked, they'd be hurting just as much as the next guy. It's in their interest to maintain network health and ensure enough liquidity for them to cash-in their efforts. So I think there's some general incentive-alignment there to put your mind at ease.

Like it or not, bitcoin mining in China is important to the crypto ecosystem as a whole, in the same way AWS is important to the internet ecosystem. For that reason, I think it's wise to continue to pay close attention to the dynamics of mining in China. For example, due recent efforts to meet climate change targets and push the carbon-neutral narrative, China is reportedly shutting down crypto-mining operations in Inner Mongolia, along with other energy-intensive industries.

How does this affect the distribution and competitiveness of China's bitcoin mining? What does it speak to more general questions - e.g. as Bitcoin's network value grows, how will we maintain the economic value of POW network security when it is directly tied to energy consumption - and can energy consumption scale in the same fashion? Currently the energy consumption of Bitcoin is comparable the total energy consumption of Kazakhstan, with a carbon footprint comparable to that of the country of Hungary. And that's *just Bitcoin*. If the price and hashrate trend continues, we're likely looking at more. So as we ask these questions, we should continue to keep a close eye on China's energy policy stances and the general landscape of bitcoin miners and their migrations in the region.

Technical skills are important. Python, Tableau, SQL, etc...With so many free resources, the number of learning options can be overwhelming. Worse yet, I think there can be a lot of uncertainty going from learning to nabbing a job in analytics.

As I've considered my own career, I remember struggling a lot with what to do as I was learning tools like Tableau or programming languages like Python. For me, the big goal was always a job. Early on, I didn't feel like I had enough to offer a company. But I overcame that lack of experience and landed an analytics job with zero years of experience. Here are a few recommendations based on what I did:

* Solve real world problems outside of your learning context. So many courses and tutorials are meant to make you feel accomplished. But the way you'll continue to learn is by solving real world problems outside of your learning environment.
* Talk the talk. Okay, you need to be able to follow your talk with results. But a lot of getting a job involves being able to talk about your skills in a format the company is looking for. Otherwise, they won't recognize you possess the skills they're looking for
* Get creative by showcasing your projects. Even if your projects were apart of a tutorial, showcase it. I saw a great way of doing this on a LinkedIn profile the other day. He was enrolled in a coding boot camp, but listed his projects as separate experiences on LinkedIn. Some recruiters will be rigid with only reaching out to people with full-time work experience, but some recruiters just want someone with the skills their company is looking for.

Project link: [GitHub repo for Magic: The Gathering](https://github.com/VincenzoGalante/magic-the-gathering)

Project background:

* I used to play Magic: The Gathering a lot back in the 90s
* I wanted to understand the game from a meta perspective and tried to answer questions that I was interested in

Technologies used:

* Infrastructure via terraform, and GCP as cloud
* I read the [scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/) for card data
* Push them to my storage bucket
* Push needed data points to BigQuery
* Transform the data there with DBT
* Visualize the final dataset with [Looker](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ebdf68e1-27f7-435b-8add-a4018681f801)

I’ve made reports and edited some code(copy and paste and edit existing code), but I think I still have a considerable gap and learning curve, and also, it’s hard for me to really “analyze” stuff. I want to be more hands-on and stop always looking for my teammates for help. Is there any advice that you all can give, or am I going through imposter syndrome

ool3pd,dataanalysis,1626854809.0,"So, I have a decent grasp on data analytics and use python quite a bit, but I am fairly new to the field in general. I recently got hired by a marketing firm doing data analytics, and while I can run different tests and understand that what I am doing is pointless from an analytics standpoint, I'm not sure what I am doing from a marketing standpoint. 

For instance, I know checking for ROI on PPC ads is a must, and I can run conversions per ad and get them info that's more than what they are asking.

My current assignment is a Social Media analysis, and I can do a check of keywords vs metrics like ""Likes"", ""Comments"", ""Shares"", and all that. But I feel like there is more to it than that in the Digital Marketing space. I have done some testing that pulled information like looking at words that seem to cause posts to get more likes and hashtags that seem to be more useful than others. 

What exactly am I looking for metric-wise to do testing on to see what's working?

For example, a loan company is a client, they want to know how well their social media presence 
is doing. Do I try to get their loan data to see any correlation between people who clicked  through their social media to website to ""contact for more information""? How would I find the  link for people who submitted a contact form on the website to those that came from social  media? That would be the true proof that SM is working, right? I can follow the trend of course, but is there some metric that has a name that I am missing besides CTR?

Basically, what are the most important metrics for testing in the digital marketing field if I had to 
give my boss a list of the metrics I need in order to do my job. No one at the firm currently does Data Analytics using python, so I already have eyes on me, so far they are decently impressed, but in reality, I am just pulling stuff out of my butt and it's somehow working.

(Yes, I am over my head. That's why I'm here. However, this job is one that will make my future 
100x better as I have been out of a job for over a year due to covid, and this is finally a career launcher for me, so I want to succeed so badly since I am already in my 30s and finally have a chance to make a future for myself and my family.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/ool3pd/recently_hired_by_marketing_firm_doing_data/,"Recently hired by marketing firm doing data analytics, need some guidance.

15e5ykz,dataanalysis,1690777505.0,"Looking for some input and for any advice. 

I work in the health tech field as a data analyst/BI dev at a fortune 100 company and have about 1.5 years experience. A lot of my day to day consists of writing sql queries to build backend logic for various long term initiatives we have, completing sql related ad hoc requests, and creating/maintaining/enhancing power bi dashboard for internal stakeholders.

Current Company: 

For the most part, i enjoy my job. I like my team and the work i do. My current compensation is ~$83,000, 401K with decent employer match, employer contribution to my HSA, unlimited PTO, 10% bonus to be payed out in december (will talk about this later). 

Back in march, my manager left for another company. We were pretty close and I was bummed about their leaving especially since i was still relatively early in my career and stint with the company. For the next few months, i was assigned a new manager and we tried to fill the knowledge gap that was left with my old manager leaving. It was rough but we managed and i like my new manager. We get along and they have a lot of technical experience that could help further my career. 

New Offer:

My old manager reached out to me a month ago and asked if i’d be interested in joining them at their new company. I would transition to a senior DA role and they would bump my pay up anywhere from 15-20% higher than it is now. From what i’ve seen the 401k and health/vision/dental are all slightly better. Not sure about pto. Have a meeting with their HR soon to get more questions answered more 

The job itself seems a bit more up my alley. I would work more on shorter term adhoc projects rather than long term ones. There would also be a larger variety in the types of projects given the fact that the new company is medium size health care consultancy firm. The data team at the new company is smaller so there will be some growing pains but it seems their mission for the future, growing the team, and implementing best practices is solid. 

I believe the new company can also help develop my skills and set myself up for the future well given the previous/current experience of everyone on the new team.

My concerns:

1. General guilt leaving my current company. Especially when there isnt anything they’ve done wrong. The only issue is that i’d like shorter term projects than the longer term projects i currently do.

2. If i decline the offer from my old manager, especially after 3 rounds of interviews, that would reflect poorly on him. 

3. If i leave my current company, i would forfeit my bonus due at the end of the month (i think). I have asked if the new company can offset this by offering a sign on bonus. They said they’d get back to me.

4. Leaving a company after 1.5 years. How does that look on a resume? 

5. Growing pains of a new/young data team. 

6. Leaving a fortune 100 company when i’m not unhappy. 

7. Anything else i need to be concerned about/ask during HR meeting?

yirwih,dataanalysis,1667257712.0,"I’m hoping you can help me rediscover my enthusiasm for data. I want to make sure I’ve tried my best to make this job work before I decide to leave.

My current job is the type of job that I used to dream of having. I still really like the idea of it but I’m not happy. Seeing everyone on here working so hard to get a good job similar to mine makes me question if I’m being spoiled/unappreciative.

My job:
- fully remote
- nice coworkers and manager
- a start-up in the Bay Area with an innovative product 
- I use Tableau, SQL, python, excel
- I get to work with many teams across the company
- I even have a data scientist teammate spend 1hr/week teaching me data science (used to be my dream to become one)
- low 6 figures
- very few meetings 
- I get to go to cool team offsites in different cities once in a while. My teammates are all great ppl 

I used to love the idea of spending all day building dashboards on Tableau and sharing interesting insights to the broader company. But now every day I feel like I am met with more challenges than I can handle:
- I get discouraged when I make mistakes (pointed out by stakeholders or in my QC process, both are frustrating because it takes time to correct the issue)
- deadlines are stressful. I always take longer to finish a project than anticipated, so sometimes I end up working till late at night. (Then this impacts my relationships and other non work commitments)
- a lot of ppl have questions/requests for me throughout the day on slack and it’s quite time consuming and distracting to respond
- sometimes I have low discipline and would spend hours on my phone instead of working. This is my fault but there are times when I just can’t bring myself to work anymore. This creates even more stress
- I thought I could travel but the time differences make me tired and I can’t fully enjoy my travels while working 8hrs a day. It actually takes a lot of effort and planning to be able to travel and work efficiently
- because work takes a lot of my time and energy I feel like I’m not growing in other aspects of my life (developing soft skills, work on my hobbies, reconnecting w friends and families, learning and researching topics that interest me). I feel like I’m becoming a dull and boring person with major social anxiety because  I spend all day interacting with a computer.

Off the top of my head, I would say that the following non-exhaustive list constitute problem-solving skills:

1. Being able to break a large problem down into smaller components, making each one easier to address
2. Tracing the root cause. Some professions call this root-cause analysis or ""the 5 whys"".
3. Figuring out how you will test if the problem is solved
4. Recognizing when you haven't broken down the problem enough to be able to test solutions effectively
5. Using the process of elimination
6. Developing thought experiments to explore ""what if"" - I find these handy by testing extremes to figure out the boundary of the issue e.g. what if X always happens? What if it never happens? What if the value was infinite, what if it was zero? What if it didn't exist at all?
7. Developing a mental model of the fundamentals drivers/philosophy of why you are trying to achieve the thing the problem is preventing. Sometimes you identify how to bypass the problem entirely
8. Recognising all the resources at your disposal to solve the issue, and searching for new ones if needed. This could be time, money, or more often than not, expertise of others. 

&#x200B;

What's your take on this? Have you come across any more formal thinking on what it is to have good problem-solving skills?

Just to start off, I didn't get the job unfortunately. 

But this is how it went:

They first emailed me about a week or so after I submitted my application online asking for a phone call at a given date and time. Come that day, I got a call and the interviewer (who was very upbeat and enthusiastic) gave me an outline of what he was looking for in my responses to his questions: projects done, positions/roles held, time span, accomplishments, goals, barriers, etc. I think I forgot about this and did my usual elevator pitch (which did include most of what he was looking for but I wasn’t actively thinking about answering them. Like when he asked what coding languages besides SQL i had experience in, I forgot to tell him how long I’ve had experience with them. 

Overall the call was about 15 minutes. He didn’t give me the opportunity to ask him questions which was odd for me but I’m guessing that because they’re so well known that it’s not needed to show you researched them.

I’m not sure if not fully answering the criteria he was looking for in my responses is what killed me or they just found a better candidate. Either way, I think it was a good experience. 

I actually ended up getting a remote job with a government contracting company that I interned with last summer. I did have to use some nepotism (family connections) unfortunately to get the job so I don’t really have any advice for you guys on how I got the job. But as a soon college grad I’ll take what I can get just to get my foot in the door.

Anyways, thank you guys so much for all the encouragement and advice!

Breaking into the tech industry can seem like a daunting task, especially if you're starting from scratch. However, with the right mindset, skills, and strategies, you can land your dream job in tech as a data analyst. In this blog, we'll explore how to break into tech by being a data analyst.

Develop Technical Skills:
As a data analyst, you'll be working with data, which means you'll need to have some technical skills. You should start by learning Excel, SQL, and a programming language like Python or R. You can take online courses, watch tutorial videos, or even attend a boot camp. Additionally, it is important to learn data visualization tools like Tableau and PowerBI.

Get Hands-On Experience:
Learning technical skills is only half the battle. You need to get some hands-on experience by working on projects. You can start by participating in online data analysis competitions or creating your projects using public data sets. Moreover, you can look for freelance projects on websites like Upwork, Freelancer or Fiverr. This will not only help you apply your skills in a real-world context but also create a portfolio of your work that you can showcase to potential employers.

Network with Industry Professionals:
Networking is an essential part of any job search, and the tech industry is no different. Attend networking events, meetups and connect with industry professionals on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter or Reddit. Furthermore, join online communities such as Reddit's r/datascience, LinkedIn Groups, or Kaggle forums, where you can get advice, support, and learn from industry professionals.

Consider Getting Certifications:
Certifications can be a great way to demonstrate your skills and knowledge in a specific area of data analytics. Certifications such as SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, and Python/R can give you a competitive edge and make your resume stand out to potential employers.

Apply for Data Analyst Jobs:
After you have gained some technical skills, hands-on experience, networked with professionals, and acquired certifications, it's time to start applying for data analyst jobs. Use online job boards like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, or Monster, and create a compelling resume and cover letter that highlights your skills, experience, and certifications.

In conclusion, breaking into tech as a data analyst requires developing technical skills, gaining hands-on experience, networking with professionals, acquiring certifications, and applying for jobs. With persistence and hard work, you can succeed in the tech industry as a data analyst.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/120bn9o/tips_to_becoming_a_data_analyst/,Tips to becoming a data analyst!,21,28,0.69

I was expecting sql questions, and certain cases where i have to showcase my understanding of joins, subqueries, stored procedures. However, the email told me that i will be given a sample data set and given one hour to give insights on the data. they also expect me to provide one or more slides communicating my findings.

  
At first i was relieved because it sounds easy, but the more i think about it the more stressed I get. Im not sure what DBMS software to use, my first thought is that i wouldnt even need to use SQL? because its all data visualization so i thought i would focus on refreshing my tableau skills and making dashboards. and maybe even microsoft visual studio for data mining? can anyone please recommend me whats the best way to display these insights? and what insights specifically should i be focusing on?

Well anyway, back to my questions. I am on week 3 of the google certificate and I have sort of been breezing through it. Until today. I hit a brick wall when I was doing the SQL BigQuery stuff. I was doing the query exercises with the SQL whatnots (I'm learning the lingo okay lol!!). No matter what I did I came up with syntax errors. I typed everything in perfectly but syntax errors were all I came up with. I had to copy and paste the queries from the exercises in order to get anything correct. I want to learn how to do this correctly. I don't want to be copying and pasting things. 

Can someone please help me :(

Let me know if I need to clarify anything. I'm sure my question is a bit confusing. That question is how do I write correct queries that don't result in nothing but syntax errors?

The more analyses I made and presented, the more people would come to me and ask for support in order to benefit their own personal goals within the company. For example, my boss needed to convince someone above him of doing things in a certain way which would give his department an advantage against another, so he asked me to analyze data and after I sent it, it proved the opposite point he was trying to prove, so he said I should rework the analysis to hide that and highlight something else. 

If that wasn't shady enough, I did the same thing for a manager much higher above him and the person told me ""We don't need to show this part to the president, make sure you delete it"", referring to a part where the data was contradicting the manager.

I was not very good at maths or algebra or calculus. I have a basic understanding of python - not very good at it meaning i cant code my own thing but i can figure out ways to make a code work by copying it from open source and then making changes to it to work for me. I did start a google data analytics course for beginners. Hoping to learn alot. Plus what made me realize i like working with data is when i noticed in my old job some of the systems werent working properly and When i looked at the data i noticed a pattern where when the data is extracted from the system it is not accurate to what it should be.

11ufz4h,dataanalysis,1679119187.0,"In today's data-driven world, Snowflake has emerged as a popular cloud-based data warehousing platform. However, managing costs and ensuring optimal performance can be a challenge.  


In this post, I will share my tactics of cutting my client's Snowflake costs by 65% and boosting performance by 50% that you can use too!  


Efficient Data Loading:  
​​​​​​​1.1 Sort data on ingestion  
1.2 Use the CSV (Gzipped) format  
1.3 Use COPY INTO instead of INSERT  
1.4 Use Snowpipe for continuous, real-time data ingestion  
1.5 Use file formats optimized for Snowflake, such as Parquet or ORC  
1.6 Use a separate staging area for data loading  


Optimize Compute Resources:  
2.1 Use Virtual Warehouses to scale compute resources on demand  
2.2 Use Auto-Suspend to automatically suspend inactive warehouses  
2.3 Use Auto-Resume to automatically resume suspended warehouses  
2.4 Use Multi-Cluster Warehouses for high-concurrency workloads  
2.5 Use Snowflake's Resource Monitors to allocate resources based on priorities  
2.6 Use query control parameters to manage concurrency and query processing  
2.7 Set automatic suspension and resizing  


Efficient Script Writing:  
3.1 Avoid temporary tables - Use common table expressions (CTEs) wherever possible  
3.2 Use window functions instead of subqueries  
3.3 Avoid using DISTINCT and GROUP BY together  
3.5 Use the query profile to identify inefficient queries  
3.6 Use the TIMEZONE function to avoid time zone conversion issues  


Optimize Storage:  
4.1 Use S3 buckets in the same geographic region  
4.2 Keep file sizes between 60-100 MB to benefit from parallel loading  
4.3 Avoid using materialized views except in specific use cases  
4.4 Use Snowflake's Zero-Copy Cloning feature to create lightweight copies of data  
4.5 Use the VARIANT data type for semi-structured data to reduce storage costs  
4.6 Use Snowflake's Data Sharing feature to share data between accounts or regions  
4.7 Use partitioning to improve query performance and reduce storage costs  
4.8 Use object metadata to manage and track data usage and retention policies.  


Some of the key takeaways in this post include optimizing data loading, compute resources, script writing, and storage, as well as adopting best practices for query management and governance.  


By following these tactics, you can also achieve significant cost savings and performance improvements in your Snowflake environment.  


I hope you found these tactics helpful in optimizing your Snowflake costs and performance. If you did, please consider showing your support by liking and sharing this post. I'd love to hear your own tips too, so feel free to leave a comment. Also, join the Snowflake Mastery group for more tips and insights on Snowflake.

*Always looking to improve and would like some advice and critiques for a project I submitted to a job and ended up getting rejected.*

I had a take home project for a job. The task was to analyze some data and return my findings. I did not get the job, but would like some feedback from someone who does this kind of thing on a regular basis.

I emailed the employer for some feedback and they just stated that 'they did not think I asked and answered enough questions' in the project. Okay, fair enough. I didn't get any examples of what I could have done better which is why I am here. I never claimed to be a data analyst on my resume either. I was under the impression that this was a data software engineer and I met about 90% of the requirements. Thank you in advance.

Below is pretty much exactly what I did.

Given:

**Table 1:**

* **Products** 

1. product\_id
2. department\_name
3. height
4. width
5. depth
6. weight

**Table 2:**

* **Purchase\_Header**

1. purchase\_id
2. purchase\_date
3. purchase\_time

**Table 3:**

* **Purchase\_Lines**

1. purchase\_id
2. product\_id
3. quantity

**Instructions:**

* Given the data, return your findings.
* There is no deadline or time limit (return at convenience).
* Don't make it a formal presentation. Let the code speak for itself.

*NOTE: In the first interview they mentioned not to over do it. To not spend too much time on it. Just explore and find what you can.*

I used Python/Pandas on Jupyter Notebook.

**Initial findings:**

* Primary key for products is product\_id.
* Primary key for Purchase\_Header is purchase\_id.
* purchase\_id and product\_id are the foreign keys for Purchase\_Lines.
* collectively, this is 2 weeks worth of sales data for what seems to be online orders for a grocery store.
* NULL values exist for weight and dimensions.

**Cleaning the data:**

* some item dimensions were NULL so I returned the mean, grouped by the department\_name.
* There were a couple of duplicate rows in Product\_Lines so I removed them.
* I denormalized the data so that all tables were in one table for easier look ups in Pandas.

**My Analysis/Outputs:**

* Two bar graphs each with numbers of orders placed for each department, and quantity of items from department. The first is logarithmic since produce was very large. The second was linear with produce removed.
* an approximate number of items from each department per order.
* I had a time series graph of the orders placed for the two weeks (It trended up midway through but fell just as fast a few days into the trend). Given this trend, I opted out of a recursion line and did a 3 day moving average instead.
* Another bar graph to show order count by time of day. (order density rises continually for 4AM-12PM, then slows down until about 11PM.
* a table showing the top 80% of customers shopping in one department, are likely to shop in another. i.e. 88% of customers that shop in Babies, also shop in Dairy.
* The mean weight for Department for shipping costs.

I realize I could have done more. However, they made it very clear to not over do it in the interview. Perhaps I took that a little too much to heart. I was thinking of throwing some machine learning in the mix, but when I measured to correlation between the attributes, there was nothing worth noting (I also havent messed with machine learning since college, so I could have been a little naive in that regard).

What would you have done differently? What other analysis would you have presented? I am using this rejection as a learning opportunity and would love a more detailed critiques other than 'Your analysis wasn't good enough'. 

Thanks in advance.

Just to give you an idea, this person spent hours printing out maps of individual census tracts and posting them on their office walls to see how the tracts all fit together, but still didn't have a sense of it, and apparently couldn't figure out how to use the census website to show it.

I've been doing a deep dive into the world of analytics to upskill myself as my career progresses to the demand of future jobs. It's been very fascinating, to say the least, how powerful these tools are and how they work.

I figured that with my recent discovery that I'm more left-brained in thinking than right-sided that I'd be a good fit since I tend to overthink things analytically. 😅

I've been told that all that is needed is to simply learn enough SQL + Tableau from Youtube/Udemy to be dangerous and then take that knowledge and make 1 project unique to me (preferably a passion project) in order to get a job with this as the portfolio item with a documented journey on it.

I do not have a college degree and do not plan on ever getting one at this point in my life. And I'd rather do a project around personal fitness metrics or perhaps what are the common winning factors that are proven to get someone in my situation an opportunity in this field.

Would you say that this is the correct assessment of what is needed? Or is there more that is needed to be demonstrated for a shot at a job? Such as Python or maybe a different tool of the trade?

Any advice or words of wisdom from the seasoned folks would be appreciated as I'm sure you have seen it all!

Thank you in advance. 🙏

tu20pz,dataanalysis,1648848419.0,"So, I work in healthcare. to be really specific, I work in billing, claims and coding, and i work in a sort of niche field called 'denial management.' I'm sure some of you have encountered medical billing issues with the doctor before, maybe your health insurance denied a claim and you got stuck with the bill or something went wrong and maybe you're familiar with that, right? Well, part of my job is to analyze claims and determine why they denied, what the resolution is, and then appeal it, fix coding errors, etc - whatever it is that needs to be fixed in order to get the claim paid.

I've been working in this field almost 7 years. To be clear - this job role is one that does not pay well and is considered basically at the bottom of the ladder. It's 'entry level'. At my very first job/company I ever worked for, I was on a small team for a small hospital that had a LOT of unpaid claims/revenue. Within just a few months of working at that role, I basically had taught myself how to find really big patterns, trends and problems that we were having. My boss started sending me a weekly spreadsheet that held our entire inventory in it, and requesting that I analyze it for patterns and trends. I started working through the spreadsheet (we had like over 20,000 accounts in it) and every week I was able to quickly find huge patterns and trends and show him exactly what went wrong and what we needed to do to fix it. I was making $12/hour at this role. I didn't know that the title of 'data analyst' even existed.

 I kept doing this for years at different hospitals I worked with. in October of 2021 I joined a new company and I've actually been hating it because they literally just want us to sit on the phone with the insurance company all day and we're micromanaged to hell, and the company is losing millions of dollars. A couple of months ago I started teaching myself SQL because I heard about data analysis and the money sounded really good, because I make peanuts. However, I got really discouraged because I felt like I wouldn't 'make it' in the tech world, I doubted myself, everyone in tech seems so polished and put together, and I can be a bit of a hot mess and I got so caught up in my anxieties about not 'fitting in' or looking/appearing like my personal life was 'perfect' and being able to put on that 'corporate mask' (plus my burnout was approaching an all-time high) that I backed off of teaching myself tableau after my SQL classes. 

But then I got handed a project. 
Without even having access to the inventory (my manager sends us a small spreadsheet of 30 accounts to work per day) I started identifying a pattern that was raising alarm bells in my head. I did some research, brought it to my manager, asked if she could send me a large selection of our inventory so that I could look at it and see if my theory held up and see how much of our revenue this was affecting, and so she did. And I was right. And I found a problem causing us to be down over $3 million in revenue with just one insurance company and hospital alone. She was literally blown away and beyond impressed, she asked me to write it in an email and I suggested that a powerpoint or some sort of presentation might be more effective, and she agreed. I put together a power point and sent it to her and she was blown away, couldn't stop praising my work and told me, ""I think you missed your calling as an Analyst!"" and that's when it hit me.

...... isn't this, more or less, what a data analyst does?
Have I not been doing data analyst/adjacent job functions for *years?*

All this time I thought that data analysis was a totally unrelated new field that I had *zero* experience in, that I would have to teach myself from the ground up, that I would have to 'fake it until i make it', etc. But I sort of feel like I've been hit by a truck.

Even though I've just been using spreadsheets and so the *medium* of using SQL, Tableau, etc might be a new hard skill, hasn't the basic premise been more or less the same? 

Or am I completely misunderstanding what a data analyst does?

I've been thinking that maybe I should stop doubting myself so much, and start looking for some data analyst positions in the healthcare sphere because I really do have a good degree of confidence that I could be effective and make a really great impact in that realm. 

But I've been working at the very bottom of the pyramid with such terrible pay for so long, that I almost feel like I brainwashed myself into accepting that this is where I'm supposed to be forever, or something.

I thought I would be able to help people, feel satisfied by my work and live a good life. I was not worried about the low pay as long as i can take care of myself. But I don't feel like I'm helping people and my job is thankless and under paid. I used to be very friendly with clients but now I'm very cynical. I have to protect my mental health all the time because I either have clients yelling at me or i have vulnerable clients with special needs kids going homeless and I have no way of helping them.

I want to express that I do not mind stress in a job. I know this will alway be a factor no matter what. its the type of stress that matters. If i go to work and i have a mountain of tasks to finish, that does not stress me out. Being yelled at and belittled and watching extremely sick people enter homelessness and feeling like i am responsible for it, even though I'm not, is a type of stress i do not want to experience anymore.

So, it's been about six months since I began my first data analyst role at a massive FANG-esque company, and I'm feeling a bit defeated. Despite my efforts, I just missed another deadline. This happened partly because I lost a considerable amount of time waiting for clear answers or direction, and also because I made an error when pulling a join together correctly.

The problem is, I'm always on my own trying to figure things out on my own when handling requests.  I come away from discussions with requestors not sure of what they want, and when I'm alone with zero documentation, the abundance of tables, nearly identical fields, and other complexities, I often give up trying to figure things out on my own and go directly to colleagues for direction.

My boss has been implying I should definitely be more confident on my own at this point, so I can't help but wonder if he's right and I should be better at figuring things out on my own at this stage. I've also noticed a few colleagues who are also newer (although they have more background in data analysis) seem to be doing much better than me when it comes to working independently. They probably have 25% more requests completed than I do, with more made deadlines.

Typically, my workflow looks something like this:

1. Review the request.
2. Meet with the requestor to discuss further.
3. Explore the data and try to figure things out on my own.
4. When I get stuck for more than a few hours, I ask my colleagues to point me in the right direction (usually I try looking over different tables/fields, reviewing other analysts working, sitting on things to see if anything clicks).
5. I power through and continue working on it.
6. Once I believe I'm in a good place, I request peer review.
7. Finally, I work on finalizing and delivering the request.

Someone please give it to me straight. Is this my fault? Should I be doing better at this point? Should I spend some extra time after hours trying to learn our data infrastructure better?

1. I’ve been trying to teach myself Excel and SQL but don’t know if what I’m learning will be applicable to entry level data analysis jobs. Are there any specific topics I should be studying  or playlists anyone can share so that I can better my skills? Are there any other statistical languages or programs or things in general I should be teaching myself as well? 

2. I have no clue what a data analysis portfolio is. I see people say they put “projects” in them but I’m not exactly sure what those projects are or how people get started on them. How did you create this portfolio and start working on it? How important is it in landing a job? 

3. I have received offers for data entry jobs but I see a lot of people on this sub say that data entry is often a waste of time and not relevant to data analysis. What should I be doing with my time otherwise? Working on projects? Or something else? 

4. I’m worried that my time doing nothing for the past year will work against me. Will employers care about this gap of time I took when trying to get an entry level data analyst job? 

5. Is grad school necessary for entry-level data analysis? My gut says no. But I want to see what other people think. 

6. What is the difference between data science and data analysis? Can someone clearly differentiate the two for me? 

7. How long since the start of your journey did it take for you to get your first data analysis job? 

8. Any advice in general for someone in my position? I feel kinda afraid that this might just end up being a huge waste of time but I honestly think this is what I want to do with my life and I’m not really sure what else to do with it.

I managed to land a new job in data analytics, but boy, I had no idea what I was getting into.

In essence, I actually do not know what concepts/skills I need to learn to competently complete the technical aspect of my job in PowerBI/Excel to achieve desired outcomes as I've only done some very basic work with data.  I look at a colleagues PowerBI report and analyse the data source, and I can see that they have set up new columns as calculation columns, unpivoting data, etc. before generating dashboards/visual reports.

From what I'm understanding in these reports created by my colleague, my colleague has the ability to look at a raw data source and understands exactly what steps need to be applied to be able to produce the desired outcome.  I am coming to learn PowerBI and the functions within it over time which will come with experience, but I feel like I'm missing a very fundamental essence to data analytics which I cannot quite put my finger on (anyone got any ideas?).

I have basic experience with working with datasets (i.e. create pivot tables, basic charts in Excel, basic visuals created from data in PowerBI), but I'm unsure what data concepts I need to learn to be able to achieve the ability to be able to get onto my colleagues level.

First,

What is the stuff most analysts need to know with regards to SQL? 

Second,

What about primary, secondary, foreign, super, candidate, and composite keys? 

What kind of statements do you write most frequently like DDL, DML, DQL, DCL, TCL? Do you have to explain the differences between all of these or identify which statements belong to each group? 

Should I know all the normal forms? Which ones are the most common you’ve seen?

Should I know about query optimization? Do I have to worry about query trees?

What about RAID? Should I know all the levels? 

How would questions present themselves in interview for SQL, would it be querying? Is it an applied question? Are they looking only for code or code & interpretation? Should I talk about the business more or the code more? 

Are there any other resources you’d recommend? I’ve been mainly going off SQLZoo, LeetCode, and DataLemur for now. I have a used book too.

I am a recent graduate (Aug 21) and my actual grad is gonna be held this May. the embarrassing moment for me is that many of my fellow friends have gotten jobs and seem to doing well (i greatly hope they are, i know things aren't what they seem sometimes) and I'm struggling terribly. I don't get a callback, I always get rejections, or denials due to visa issues. I have modified my CV and made it according to the best possible guidelines, I even picked up certain certifications, networked a bit and did two month unpaid internship at a startup in Canada (remotely) and am currently doing a data analyst internship at a company in the Middle East but I'm gonna be real with ya'll, its anything but a data analyst position and is so shitty, but I'm able to earn a small possible living (which they even pay late) 

&#x200B;

I would love to know how to get past some of these hurdles, I really wanna work abroad and want to really really gain some experience but I have no idea what to do to even put a pinky foot into the door of data analysis. I feel like my resume is pretty good but i'm so demotivated, it's sad. Any tips or leads would be so helpful, I will literally pray for you in all my prayers. 

I've attached my CV below! do offer any advice if possible! thank you so much and happy eid to all my muslim fellows.

n4cakz,dataanalysis,1620089993.0,"We interviewed different people working in data engineering to talk about the future of the data analytics space. What was particularly interesting in this exercise was how differently those interviewed thought about the future of the space. We've ﻿heard everything from streaming to cataloging to monitoring as future areas that teams believe will become front and center over the next five years. Below are the top three takeaways we had from the interviews presented in the report.

**Specialization will grow within the data team**

Most data engineers and data analysts are wearing many hats today. This is because the investment into the data team has only recently increased. As the value of data teams becomes more evident and more investment is placed in this department, data teams will specialize to focus on a particular function. This could mean having a reliability data engineer, a visualization lead, and a separation between backend and frontend data engineering teams. We believe these kinds of organizational changes will begin to take shape over the next 5 years.

**The ""data gap"" between data producers and consumers will shrink**

As more investment is directed towards self-service analytics, the gap between data consumers and data producers will continue to shrink. Tools that help teams centralize an understanding of data will become mandatory across all data teams. We've solved storing data, and moving data, as well as visualizing data. When we look at the challenges that a team faces today, the idea of self-serve analytics and understanding is the next largest issue.

**Data will become a product**

More data teams will adopt practices that help them ﻿measure, manage and develop data like a product team. On the surface, this might mean a transition towards agile project management. At a more intricate level, this might mean transitioning towards data tools that enable cross-organization collaboration, version control, and monitoring. We believe that innovation in this area of data analytics will be interesting.

* Have a question (say, about Bike Share usage)
* Find or pull together data
* Punch it into Tableau

It showcases (possibly) new capabilities such as:

* Cleaning data in uploaded CSV file
* Solving mathematical problem by uploading image file
* Given programming task for building regex to accept phone number, it iteratively refines its own solution

The important point it notes is that ChatGPT runs its own code on the server, determines if its correct or not and then refines it if it is not, instead of returning incorrect solution.

I admit that I have not gone extensively through expert opinion on how this will affect programmers. But I am still curious if anyone has some interesting / important opinion. Also I know most of these questions will be answered as time passes. But, here are some of my questions:

12an9lh,dataanalysis,1680534435.0,"Hi! I could really use some direction here because I am finding no help online.

I recently started working at a company that handles all of their data analysis and data visualization using Excel. This company is usually crunching hundreds of thousands lines of data at a time, which you could imagine is absolutely terrible for Excel. After about a month of watching Excel crash and not respond, I was able to convince my boss to let me spend time designing a better way to handle our data. Here's what I have so far.

I have a MySQL database for storing data, alongside a python script that manages data coming into the database and making sure the data is clean and up-to-date.

Then, for each report we want to make, we create a python script that reads the necessary data from the MySQL database, preform the necessary calculations, and save the calculated data to a pandas DataFrame. This is as far as I have come.

There seems to be no good, easy way of visualizing a pandas DataFrame. I first tried OpenPyXL, but these that is exceptionally slow, hard to add color, and not much support for adding charts and visuals. Matplotlib can't create large, easy-to-read tables. I would love to use Power BI, but loading in data using the ""Python script"" is not scalable at all, and is an absolute nightmare since many of my python scripts depend on other files in their relative directories. Connecting to Power BI's REST API doen't seem that easy either

One solution I thought of was sending the resulting Dataframe back to MySQL, then reading the data off MySQL into Power BI to create the official report. At that point, it seems I've created a quite complicated data life cycle:

    DataSource --> SQL Manager (python script) --> Raw Data table (MySQL database) --> Report calculations (python script) --> Calculated Data Table (MySQL database) --> Report Dashboard (Power BI) --> emailed to employees.

Excel might be slow at handle lots of data, but at least everything is in one place. How can I make this process more professional and less complicated? I am trying to prove that this way is much better than just using excel to my boss. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

(side note: I understand you can import SQL data right into power bi, but our reports require a whole bunch of calculations. I have been able to write some of our reports as one SQL query, but bunching everything to just one query isn't very readable.

My former boss recently reached out to me and asked me what my rates would be for contract work. He would like me to clean and organize some spreadsheets, calculate some information for his board of directors (demographic and programmatic data), and create some visuals to explain the data.  All of this will be used in the organization's annual report. When I was employed by this boss, I did the same work over the course of a few weeks, really only working on it in my free time as it wasn't a part of my day-to-day tasks. I do not remember it being especially difficult or time-consuming.  Additionally, he wants me to re-calculate and clean the data once every two weeks for the remainder of the year. I do not think this would be very difficult or time-consuming either, as I don't anticipate too much new information coming in at this time of the year.   


I have never done any kind of contract work before, so I'm at a bit of a loss for how much to charge for this work. While I don't want to undersell myself, the organization is a non-profit, and I am decent friends with the boss even now, so I don't want to overcharge.

I graduated with a BS in Biology from a 4 year public university a few years back and have been working in a clinical like setting conducting hearing tests to clients. The transferable skills from this job to any analyst position would be presenting the data (what their hearing test means) to the client so that they understand where they're at and building rapport/relationship with them as well for trust, etc to eventually sell them something (interpersonal/communication skills). 

I've also self taught myself Python, JavaScript, and SQL over the past ~2 years and have gotten to an intermediate level with all 3 languages.

When applying for analyst positions that requires presentation skills (presenting data & findings to clients) and most importantly SQL/Python, how would I present that on a resume to get HR's / hiring managers attention?

Could I literally write

Skills: Python, SQL

to show that I know python and SQL and that's it? Or would I need to show actual proof on a resume (whether its a link to your GitHub or a 'project' section) that I am competent with these languages such as in depth projects that relates to the analyst role that I am applying for? 

If I can just write down 'Skills: Python, SQL' on my resume and that's it and just expect to solve 'leetcode' like questions during an interview to prove competency, that's no problem. But if I actually need to have projects, etc. listed on my resume just to get past HR, then that's an issue because now I have to figure out what to make even if I know I have the skill.

3pbrla,analysis,1445239291.0,"I have been extremely confused, amazed, and frustrated with the HBO series, The Leftovers. At the same time I am compelled to stay invested as it is such an artfully crafted production, as well as an increasing  need to resolve all the bizarre mysteries in this story.

I read an excerpt from an interview with MImi Leder, one of the shows producers/creators, that shed some bit of light. Leder indicated that The Leftovers is a story about what people choose to beleive and how, sometimes, when they believe so completely, it comes true.  

I think that in the case of the Leftovers, art is imitating life.  The era in which we live, at least from my scope of exoerience, people's tendency and core-driven need to believe (in anything, just something) has, ir is very close to flying off the rails.  Yet the phenomenon about which belief is chosen, is something that no human could ever know with certainty.

This idea really resonated with me in the latter part of season 2 episode 3, when Tom tells his mother that the failed rescue was a consequence of taking that ""thing"" from the  ex Guilty Remnent left her empty and drove her to suicide.  Two concepts are expressed here: that the beiief (which is all quite vague and capricious, even to its own members) and structure offered by rhe GR satisfies a deeply seated need in us humana and that the surrender to that belief yields a great deal of power to this thing called the Guilty Remnent.  

As I ponder these concepts of the power of individual belief and this near survival driven need for understanding, as well aa the tendency of humans to take a path of least resistance by consuming a whole paradigm of belief blindly, I can't help but think of the current political discourse in the USA, and some of the extremities of ideology from groups like the Tea Party. 

I feel, through the deliberate vagueness of this show, that there is a strong message that our own choice as to what we believe is an extrem5powerful faculty, and this story ssems to offee a warning not to squander that  power by surrendering to some structured doctrine.
