# ✏️ Extracting data from Reddit API
You can also register to use Reddit's API [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
## 💡 Tried this to figure out how data extraction works by using public API
### 📊 Pulled data from sub reddits r/analysis and r/dataanalytics as it is the most visited sub reddits by me to learn about data analytics
This project was done for a specific problem I was facing: to get my questions answered about data analytics. As my main platform to seek answers for a topic is reddit, I extracted data from the two main sub reddits for data analysis ;r/analytics and r/dataanalysis.
Then using ChatGPT's API, I created a bot that uses only the data I give(i.e extracted data from Reddit), the bot gives me the answer for the speific question I prompt it to. Thus making it easier for me to rather browse through the entire reddit. 
#### I got inspired on how to create the CHATgpt bot [here](https://medium.com/@sohaibshaheen/train-chatgpt-with-custom-data-and-create-your-own-chat-bot-using-macos-fb78c2f9646d) to check how to create chatgpt bot
